A proactive learner with proven success in national competitions and a strong drive for innovation.","I, Md. Rezoan Khan, am the student leader behind the development of AgriEye. Even though I am the main developer, I have worked with mentors and peers to get their opinions on AI implementation and agricultural challenges. Research, software integration, testing, and model development (YOLOv8) are all part of my job. Currently a solo endeavor, there is potential for future growth into a startup or larger team.","Most farmers in Bangladesh do not have any institutional education in agriculture. Almost all of them adopt this profession through inheritance. As a result, they continue farming in traditional ways. They often make decisions by imitating other farmers. They are not well aware of the different types of crop diseases. Sometimes, without any real necessity, they use various chemicals just by following others. Consequently, crop production is often hampered, desired yields are not achieved, and health risks are created. We are proposing AgriEye as a smart and futuristic solution to this problem. AgriEye is an AI-powered smart mini drone that flies over crops, scans them, and detects various existing diseases. It then generates a smart report covering the entire field. The report will include necessary remedies and preventive measures.
Based on the current condition of the leaves, our futuristic mini drone will also be able to provide information about potential upcoming diseases.
In short, it will become a blessing for farmers. It can provide detailed information about areas of the field that are hard for humans to reach directly. As a result, unnecessary pesticide use will be avoided, and overall production will increase.","As of today, there is no AI-powered mini drone system or even standalone AI-based solution being used in the agricultural sector in Bangladesh for disease detection. And certainly, no such system is being produced commercially.
Globally, a few major brands use large-sized drones for various agricultural tasks—such as spraying pesticides, fertilizers, and even disease detection. However, due to their multifunctional design, these drones become significantly large and expensive, often costing between $25,000 to $30,000 on average.
In contrast, our proposal is to develop a dedicated mini drone focused solely on crop disease detection. This drone will be compact, lightweight, and significantly more affordable. Based on our preliminary estimates, we believe we can produce each unit within $250 to $300, making it a highly cost-effective and unique solution compared to existing global offerings.
It can also be able to monitor soil quality and weather condition of the field and give a proper instruction to farmer.","Some special features of our mini drone are:
1. Realtime monitoring and live detection.
2. Low hardware requirements
3. Exclusive report with efficient solution
4. Soil and weather condition monitoring
5. Effective for multiple crops","AgriEye uses cutting-edge deep learning technology (YOLOv8) to identify diseases in real time. The model was fine-tuned for high accuracy on local disease conditions using datasets of rice leaves. Because of its efficiency and portability, the system can be installed on inexpensive IoT boards, smartphones, or regular laptops.

","Urban centers in Bangladesh, particularly Dhaka and Chattogram, face significant challenges due to traffic congestion and delayed emergency response. Peak-hour traffic frequently reduces vehicle speeds below 5 km/h, resulting in substantial economic losses, increased fuel consumption, and logistical inefficiencies. Road accidents and other emergency situations
often experience delayed detection and response, negatively impacting public safety.

The proposed platform addresses both challenges through an integrated system of low-cost IoT traffic sensors, existing CCTV cameras, and edge computing nodes. Traffic data is compressed to optimize network usage, while critical events, such as accidents or emergency vehicle movements, are prioritized for immediate processing. This dual approach facilitates improved traffic flow, expedited emergency response, and the generation of actionable data for city traffic management, logistics, ride-sharing, and municipal planning.","The platform differentiates itself by addressing traffic congestion and public safety concurrently within a single industrial-grade system:
• Integrated Solution: Combines urban mobility optimization with emergency response management.
• Locally Tailored: Designed specifically for Bangladesh’s low-bandwidth networks, intermittent power supply, and budget-sensitive contexts.
• Scalable and Industrial-Ready: Capable of incremental deployment, starting from high-priority junctions or hospital zones and expanding to cover entire cities.
• Economic and Social Value: Supports commercial operations such as fleet management and ride-sharing, while simultaneously enhancing public safety.","The platform provides the following capabilities:
• Real-Time Traffic Monitoring: IoT sensors and cameras continuously monitor
vehicle movement and congestion.
• Dynamic Traffic Signal Control: AI algorithms adjust traffic lights dynamically,
reducing congestion by an estimated 15–20% during peak hours.
• Emergency Vehicle Prioritization: Ambulances and first responders are provided with priority routing, reducing response times by up to 30%.
• Incident Detection: Accidents, traffic violations, and anomalous events are detected and flagged in real time for rapid intervention.

Most programming languages use English-based syntax, which creates difficulty for beginners in Bangladesh and other Bengali-speaking regions. Many students, especially from rural areas, lose interest in programming because they cannot relate to the English keywords.

Ojogor solves this problem by introducing Bangla syntax for Python-like programming, allowing learners to write code in their mother tongue. With simple, intuitive commands such as “দেখাও” (print), “যদি” (if), and “যতক্ষণ” (while loop), programming becomes more natural and beginner-friendly.

The project includes an independent interpreter, ongoing development of a mobile IDE, and a VS Code extension (under testing). This ensures accessibility across devices and platforms.

By making programming available in Bengali, Ojogor lowers the entry barrier for students, helps educational institutions teach coding in the native language, and inspires a new generation of innovators.","Ojogor is unique because it is the first full-fledged programming language with Bangla syntax, not just a translation layer or tutorial in Bengali. Unlike traditional programming environments that only allow comments or variable names in Bangla, Ojogor introduces core keywords, control structures, and functions entirely in Bangla.

This makes programming intuitive for beginners, as they can directly relate coding concepts with their natural language. Ojogor also maintains simplicity through dynamic typing, no semicolons, and easy-to-read structure, ensuring quick adoption for new learners.

Additionally, Ojogor is built as an independent interpreter with extensions under development (mobile IDE and VS Code support), making it scalable for both educational and professional use. Its open-source nature ensures continuous innovation and community-driven growth — something not found in similar localized attempts.","Core Functionality:

Independent interpreter that executes Bangla syntax code.

Supports variable declaration, user input, output display, conditionals, loops, and functions in Bangla.

Dynamic typing for simplicity (no need to define variable types).


Key Features:

Bangla Syntax Keywords → e.g., “দেখাও” (print), “যদি” (if), “যতক্ষণ” (while loop).

Beginner-Friendly → clean syntax, no semicolons, simple structure.

Cross-Platform Potential → works on PC, mobile IDE under development, VS Code extension under testing.

Open Source → available on GitHub for contributions, transparency, and growth.

Educational Focus → designed to help students and beginners learn programming concepts in their mother tongue.","Ojogor applies technology in a simple yet powerful way to break the language barrier in programming. It is built with an independent interpreter, ensuring that Bangla syntax is not just symbolic but actually executable. The interpreter is lightweight, making it accessible on low-spec devices that are common among students in Bangladesh.

The project follows modern software practices:

This multi-modal system integrates smoke sensors, computer vision, and temperature monitoring to ensure accurate and timely responses. The process initiates with an MQ2 smoke sensor that continuously monitors for potential fire incidents. Upon detecting smoke, a custom-trained YOLOv11n computer vision model is activated to visually confirm the presence of fire using existing CCTV infrastructure. If the visual confirmation is positive, an alarm is triggered immediately. However, if the model does not detect a fire, a third layer of validation is initiated, where an LM35 temperature sensor checks for a significant rise in ambient temperature. This layered approach ensures a comprehensive and reliable fire detection system that balances accuracy, speed, and resource efficiency, making it a practical solution for residential, commercial, and industrial settings.","The uniqueness of our solution lies in its hierarchical, multi-sensor validation approach, which addresses the critical flaws of conventional fire detection systems. Unlike standalone smoke detectors prone to false alarms from non-fire sources like dust or steam, or computationally expensive continuous video analysis systems, our framework activates its more resource-intensive components only when necessary. The ""always-on, first-alert"" smoke sensor acts as a low-power trigger for the AI-powered visual verification. This sequential activation of sensors, from smoke to computer vision and finally to temperature, creates a fail-safe mechanism that drastically minimizes false positives. Furthermore, the system is designed to be hardware-agnostic and can be integrated with existing CCTV networks, making it a cost-effective and scalable solution that can be adapted to various indoor environments without requiring expensive infrastructure overhauls. The use of a lightweight YOLOv11n model ensures that the system can run on standard surveillance hardware, eliminating the need for high-end computational resources.","Our fire detection system is built on a three-layer validation process to ensure high accuracy and reliability. Key functionalities and features include:
Primary Smoke Detection: An MQ-2 gas sensor continuously monitors the environment for smoke particles, serving as the primary trigger for the system. This component is highly energy-efficient as it is the only part of the system that is always active.
AI-Powered Visual Verification: Upon smoke detection, a custom-trained YOLOv11n AI model analyzes the live feed from a connected camera to visually confirm the presence of flames. This model can accurately detect various types of fires, including those from cooking oil, electrical sources, gas, liquids, metals, and solids.
Temperature Cross-Validation: If the AI model does not detect a fire despite the presence of smoke, an LM35 temperature sensor is activated as a fail-safe. A sharp increase in temperature will trigger an alarm, ensuring that fires are detected even if they are visually obstructed.
False Alarm Mitigation: The multi-layer validation process ensures that alarms are only triggered when there is corroborating evidence from at least two different sources, significantly reducing false positives from common environmental factors.
Seamless Integration: The system is designed to integrate with existing CCTV surveillance networks, making it a cost-effective and easily deployable solution.","The technological foundation of our project is a robust integration of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and advanced Artificial Intelligence. The custom-trained YOLOv11n model demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving a high precision of 97.9% and a recall of 97.1%. This high level of accuracy is critical for a life-saving application such as fire detection. The model has been trained on a diverse dataset of 9,128 images, enabling it to accurately identify six different classes of fire. The system's modular architecture, controlled by an ESP32 microcontroller, allows for wireless communication and easy scalability.
This technology is highly applicable in a wide range of indoor environments. In residential buildings, it can provide early and reliable warnings, protecting lives and property. In commercial spaces like offices and warehouses, it can prevent catastrophic financial losses and ensure business continuity. For industrial settings, where the risk of fire can be higher, this system offers a more reliable and cost-effective safety solution than traditional systems.

5) Dilir Daiyan Sadaf - (Logistics & Testing)","Our project is a low-cost wearable device designed to help blind and visually impaired people move safely without depending on others. The device uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect any head-level obstacle in front of the user within a range of up to 1 meter. Whenever an obstacle is detected, it immediately gives a sound alert so that the person can have a better understanding of his or her surroundings.

Another important feature is a GPS tracker attached with the device, which allows family members or caretakers to locate the user’s position if needed. This gives both safety and peace of mind.

The overall system is small, light, and easy to carry. It runs on a rechargeable battery and costs only about 2000–3000 taka per unit, making it very affordable for people in developing countries like Bangladesh.","1) The entire system is compactly mounted on a wearable cap, making it hands-free, lightweight, and easy for visually impaired users to carry throughout the day.

2) Combines obstacle detection and GPS tracking in a single device, providing both safety and location monitoring.

3) Affordable and locally made — costs only around 2000–3000 BDT, making it accessible for people in developing countries.

4) Designed specifically for real-life conditions such as crowded streets, narrow pathways, and uneven surfaces in Bangladesh.

5) Ease of Use: Simple operation for visually impaired users, no technical skill required.","Ultrasonic Detection: Senses obstacles within a 1 meter range.

Instant Alerts: Provides sound feedback when an obstacle is detected.

GPS Tracking: Monitors the user’s real-time location for safety and navigation.

Rechargeable Power: Long-lasting battery with energy-efficient performance.

Portable Design: Lightweight and attached to a cap to wear on the head.

","Our project uses modern embedded technology built around reliable and efficient components. The ESP32 microcontroller acts as the brain of the system, processing data from multiple sensors and controlling all outputs in real time. The microcontroller sends data to our server through the HTTPS protocol, and the server stores the data and then sends real-time information to the website via the WebSocket protocol.

For obstacle detection, we used an ultrasonic distance sensor that measures the distance to nearby objects using sound waves. It can accurately detect obstacles within a 1-meter range, providing quick sound alerts to ensure user safety.

A Ublox Neo-M8N GPS module is added for real-time location tracking, allowing family members or caretakers to locate the user whenever necessary.

Users can interact with the application via text or voice to request services such as visa support, ticket booking, hotel reservations, and itinerary planning. The solution will ensure seamless automation, real-time integration with external systems, and personalized recommendations.","1. All-in-One Travel Concierge
•	Most apps handle only one aspect (e.g., ticket booking, hotel booking, or visa services).
•	This app uniquely combines Visa + Flights + Hotels + Itinerary into one conversational platform.
•	The user doesn’t need to jump between apps like Booking.com, Skyscanner, or embassy portals.
2. AI-Driven Conversational Experience
•	Unlike traditional travel apps with forms and filters, users simply talk or chat with the app.
•	Example: “I need a 7-day trip to Paris in November under $2000” → AI instantly creates a full plan (visa steps, flight, hotel, itinerary).
3. Visa Processing Integration
•	Most travel apps avoid visa support since it’s complex.
•	This solution offers AI-guided visa application:
o	Auto-filling forms from user data.
o	Document scanning (OCR).
o	Country-specific guidance.
o	Status tracking.
•	Makes it the first end-to-end solution for international travelers.
4. Dynamic & Personalized Itinerary
•	Traditional itineraries are static templates.
•	Here, the AI creates real-time adaptive itineraries:
o	If a flight is delayed, hotel check-in & activities get rescheduled.
o	Suggestions adjust to weather, local events, and personal preferences.
5. Smart Recommendations
•	Instead of just showing lists of hotels/flights, AI understands intent and context:
o	“I want a quiet hotel near a beach with vegan food” → Provides curated options.
o	Uses machine learning to refine recommendations based on past trips.
6. Seamless Integrations
•	Unified API connections with airlines, hotels, visa agencies, and payment systems.
•	Most apps specialize in one (e.g., Expedia = hotels, Amadeus = flights).
•	This app bridges multiple providers into one experience.
7. Localized & Multilingual Support
•	Converses in multiple languages (English, Bengali, Hindi, Spanish, etc.).
•	Provides country-specific visa rules dynamically — a feature missing in global apps.
8. Proactive AI Notifications
•	Beyond simple booking reminders, the AI acts like a personal agent:
o	Alerts on price drops for flights/hotels.
o	Reminds you of visa expiry.
o	Suggests nearby events or attractions in your itinerary.
9. Scalable Beyond Travel
•	The same AI agent framework can later expand into:
o	Insurance recommendations.
o	Local transport booking (Uber, rental cars).
o	Event ticketing.
o	Business travel compliance (for corporates).
","1.	Conversational Interface (AI Agent)
o	Multilingual NLP (English + regional languages).
o	Voice & text-based interaction.

The team started in 2023 and brought glory for Bangladesh by becoming the first Asian team to reach Elon Musk’s “Not-A-Boring Competition” in the USA. In 2024 we achieved 3rd place overall and received the “Rookie Award” from The Boring Company. Again, this year, in March 2025, our cutterhead became the best. Following these, our company was RJSC registered on 10th December, 2024. It has been brought under Grameenphone's 'Cholo Bangladesh' campaign (2024-2026). Our vision is to develop a Bangladesh-made tunnel-boring industry that reduces dependence on expensive foreign contractors, lowers urban disruption, and accelerates infrastructure growth.","Our team currently has 10 members in the organogram and 25 engineers (non-paid) from leading institutions such as UTM (Universiti Teknologi Malaysia), BUET, RUET, MIST, SUST, DU, UIU, IUT, Brac University etc. Members specialize in mechanical design, electrical and electronic systems, robotics, IoT, and project management. We work in partnership with BITAC (Bangladesh Industrial Technical Assistance Centre) for lab and manufacturing facilities. Our team is currently lead by Nafis Ashraf along with several sub-team leads and engineers. This multidisciplinary approach allows us to integrate advanced automation, sensors, and data systems into heavy construction machinery  - something unprecedented in Bangladesh.","Bangladesh faces chronic problems with traffic jams, road digging by multiple agencies (WASA, DESCO, BPDB etc.), and high costs for underground utilities, sewerage, pipe jacking and metro infrastructure. Our solution is a low-cost, IoT-enabled micro-tunnel boring machine (MTBM) built entirely in Bangladesh which can do the following : 
i. It can dig precise underground passages for utilities with minimal surface disruption.
ii. It integrates real-time sensors and remote monitoring so engineers can track performance and soil conditions instantly.
iii. It’s designed to be modular and portable, making it suitable for crowded urban environments where large TBMs cannot be used. Since it is trenchless, after launching it from the 'launching station', it keeps on digging underground (while cars can ply on the road at the same time) and after it is done digging, we can extract the TBM from the retrieval station (so roads need not be blocked during the entire duration of digging).
Lastly, this technology can cut project time by 30–40%, cost by up to 50% compared with importing foreign TBMs or open-cut trenching. Besides, urban flooding is also expected to reduce by 5% (in the 1st quarter) and air pollution by 7%.","i. First Bangladesh-made tunnel boring machine with IoT integration.
ii. Recognized by Elon Musk and is constantly under R&D in collaboration with Elon's company 'The Boring Company' engineers.
iii. Cross-institutional student R&D project bringing together multiple universities and disciplines.
iv. Focused on local manufacturing using BITAC facilities, reducing costs and creating new technical skills in Bangladesh (taking BITAC on Int'l level).
v. Positioned to transform how underground infrastructure is built - faster, safer, less disruptive.
vi. Goes directly with BIDA Chairman Chowdhury Ashik's new planning of representing Bangladesh as the 'Rising Star of Asia'.","i. IoT-enabled smart machine: Our MTBM integrates pressure, temperature, vibration, soil condition and machine-health sensors into a live dashboard. The dashboard gives real-time analytics, alerts and control to project managers. Because underground GPS signals are weak or absent, the system combines inertial sensors, gyroscopes, and laser/target referencing to keep accurate navigation even in GPS-denied environments.
ii. Advanced navigation & steering: High-power navigation and steering allow centimeter-level accuracy in route following, letting us place tunnels exactly under roads, rail lines or rivers without surface disruption.
iii. Automated muck removal: A built-in conveyor/slurry system continuously removes excavated soil, cutting downtime and reducing labor needs.
iv. Modular cutter head and shield: Easily adapted for different Bangladeshi soil types.
v. Compact design: Works in congested urban areas where large imported TBMs cannot operate.
vi. Comprehensive service model: Besides selling the MTBM as a complete unit to government and non-government projects, 'Bored Tunnelers' can offer it as a service package - navigation and guidance services, IoT dashboard and analytics, mechanical and civil works, operator training and maintenance. This makes it easy for utilities or contractors to adopt the technology without buying the whole machine.
vii. Data logging & analytics: All drilling parameters are automatically recorded, allowing post-project reporting and continuous improvement.
viii. R&D in partnership with DRMTCL: Currently developing 'purpoising' capability to allow controlled steering and more efficient tunnelling.
ix. Proven in field tests: Already test-run at the Metro Rail Line-5 Depot in Hemayetpur and at Elon Musk’s The Boring Company grounds in Bastrop, Texas, USA.","i. Robust mechanical design tested in real soil conditions at BITAC.
ii. Advanced electronics and automation (Our in-house EEE team designs and fabricates custom PCBs, sensor networks, power management modules, control boards and embedded firmware, enabling seamless integration of automation, real-time data acquisition and safety features into the MTBM).
iii. Built using local manufacturing processes (CNC, 3D printing, welding) to international standards.
iv. Directly addresses Bangladesh’s pressing needs: reducing urban disruption, lowering infrastructure costs, and building domestic technical capacity.

Expertise: Bridges AI-driven software with reliable, secure hardware for resource-constrained platforms","Bangladesh’s complaint system traps citizens in cycles of delay, corruption, and neglect. People like Rima fear their evidence will be tampered with. Rafiq fears bribes will decide his case. Over half of complaints, 50.9 percent, are ignored entirely. The average case drags on for 5.3 years. Backlogs swell to 4.29 million cases with 150,000 investigations pending. Complaint follow-ups fail in 91.5 percent of cases. Corruption spreads across vital services, from passports at 86 percent to healthcare at 49 percent, draining 10,902 crore taka from households each year.

Our solution is a blockchain-based digital complaint platform. Citizens register complaints online. Artificial intelligence identifies the correct department and analyzes complaint metadata. The system notifies the responsible authority immediately. The authority verifies, requests details if needed, resolves the complaint, and replies. Higher authorities and ministries are notified at each step. The citizen confirms resolution. The entire record remains active and tamper-proof on blockchain.

This process reduces ignored complaints, prevents evidence tampering, and enforces accountability. AI speeds up assignment and reduces bias. Blockchain ensures transparency and trust. Automatic notifications to higher levels limit delays. User confirmation makes outcomes citizen-centered. With this system, citizens like Rima and Rafiq would see real-time progress, secure records, and faster resolutions without bribes or bias.","QuickSolve is unique because it goes far beyond existing platforms like the Government’s Grievance Redress System (GRS), the Consumer Complaint Management System (CCMS) of DNCRP, and Transparency International Bangladesh’s Report Corruption (RC). Where these systems often fall short, QuickSolve introduces blockchain to secure all records and evidence, ensuring they remain tamper-proof and permanently verifiable. It integrates artificial intelligence to analyze complaints and route them quickly to the right department, cutting down the years of delay that plague traditional systems. Unlike other platforms, QuickSolve guarantees user anonymity, encouraging citizens to raise complaints without fear of retaliation, and it links directly with judicial bodies for rapid escalation when necessary.

The platform is designed for accessibility through both web and mobile applications, making it easy for citizens across different regions to use, in contrast to the limited digital availability of its competitors. It keeps users informed with real-time progress tracking, solving the common frustration of failed follow-ups, and builds trust by requiring users to confirm resolutions before closing any case. This citizen-centered design, powered by technology and transparency, makes QuickSolve not just another complaint management system but a transformative solution that ensures accountability and restores faith in public grievance redress.","* *Blockchain security*

The frontend, built with WAGMI and React.js, offers a simple and accessible interface that allows citizens such as Rima and Rafiq to submit and track complaints without difficulty. This user-friendly experience is supported by a backend developed with Node.js and Express, ensuring smooth server-side operations and reliable API integration.

At the core of the platform is the blockchain layer, operating on a decentralized system that guarantees tamper-proof storage of evidence. This directly addresses data manipulation issues common in the current complaint process. Smart contracts, built with Solidity and managed through Hardhat, automate the rules of complaint handling, removing opportunities for bias and reducing procedural delays. By interacting with the blockchain, these contracts ensure immutable records and trustworthy outcomes.

For off-chain storage, the system uses IPFS, the InterPlanetary File System, which provides decentralized and secure data storage. This off-chain solution connects with on-chain smart contracts to strike a balance between efficiency and scalability. The backend also integrates Firebase and MongoDB for real-time management and persistent storage of data, enhancing responsiveness and operational reliability.

The governance flow begins with a user submitting a complaint through the React interface, which triggers API calls to the Express backend. Client-side JavaScript operations using web3.js interact with the smart contracts, which then execute blockchain transactions. Data is stored in IPFS and managed through Firebase and MongoDB. Each step of this workflow, from submission to resolution, is transparent, auditable, and resistant to corruption.

This integrated system directly addresses key issues such as the 50.9 percent complaint ignore rate and the 5.3-year average case duration. It supports unique features like anonymity, judicial integration, and real-time tracking, ensuring that complaints are handled quickly and fairly. By combining decentralized technologies with modern backend and frontend frameworks, QuickSolve offers a reliable and accountable solution to break through the inefficiencies and corruption of the existing system.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No,,TRUE

","The Big Problem: Imagine trying to study, but your phone keeps buzzing with TikTok videos or WhatsApp messages! That's what happens to many Bangladeshi kids trying to learn a new language. Regular apps get lost in all the distractions, making it really hard to focus and learn properly.

Our Smart Solution (Meet Luna!): We've created Luna, a special little learning friend just for your child. Think of Luna not as another app on a phone, but as a dedicated, friendly robot that only focuses on teaching English. Luna talks to your child, gives fun voice challenges, and instantly tells them if they're saying words correctly or using grammar right. Because it's a separate device, there are no distractions – just pure learning! This makes learning a new language fun and easy, helping Bangladeshi students build strong language habits.

What Makes Luna Special? (Hardware Uniqueness!): Luna isn't just a program; it's a cute, friendly physical bot that sits on your child's desk. This is super unique, especially for Bangladesh, because it:

Stops Distractions: No more getting sidetracked by games or social media. Luna's only job is to teach.

Builds Habits: Having a physical bot makes it easier for kids to remember to practice daily, turning learning into a fun routine.

Feels Personal: It's like having a dedicated tutor, making learning feel more engaging and less like a chore. This tangible, interactive approach is designed specifically to help Bangladeshi K-12 students truly master a new language.","What makes **Luna** truly special is its **hardware**: it's a dedicated, friendly physical bot, not just another distracting app that gets buried on a phone. This unique, tangible design is crucial for Bangladeshi students because it completely blocks social media and games, creating a focused, distraction-free study zone. Its physical presence helps children build strong, daily learning habits, making Luna the most reliable and effective companion for the K-12 market here.","Luna's Core Functionality: Learning Made Fun & Effective

- Md. Taohid Imam Khan Tamim ( Developer , Technology Lead) 
- Fatiha Haider ( Quality Assurance) ","Shebar Janala (সেবার জানালা), translated as “The Window of Services,” is a digital transparency platform designed to reimagine how social safety nets reach vulnerable citizens in Bangladesh. Every year, billions of taka are allocated to allowances such as widow support, disability stipends, and old-age pensions. Yet leakages, ghost beneficiaries, and exclusion errors undermine the system. According to HIES-based studies, nearly 71% of poor and vulnerable households remain excluded, while 46.5% of beneficiaries are ineligible. This dual crisis of under-coverage and mistargeting highlights the urgent need for a trust-driven, citizen-centric system.

Our innovation combines citizen voice with institutional accountability. Citizens can log complaints, share issues, and endorse community needs through mobile apps, SMS, or USSD — ensuring accessibility for low-tech users. Verified beneficiaries receive a “Digital Transparency Passport”, linked with NID verification, which logs entitlements and disbursements on an immutable blockchain ledger. This creates a tamper-proof trail visible to citizens, officials, and donors. An integrated AI engine automatically flags anomalies — ghost IDs, duplicate claims, diversion of goods — and routes complaints to the appropriate ward, union, or upazila offices.

By merging civic participation with advanced technology, Shebar Janala empowers citizens to see, know, and act. It transforms opacity into transparency, making corruption visible and accountability unavoidable. As a prototype developed and tested through civic-tech competitions like the UNDP Civic Tech Challenge, the system is already aligned with national ambitions for Smart Bangladesh 2041. Its modular design ensures scalability across 4,571 Union Parishads and 40M+ beneficiaries, while also adapting to disaster relief, subsidies, and climate resilience schemes.

Ultimately, Shebar Janala closes the gap between citizens and state, building trust through transparent processes and equitable service delivery.","The uniqueness of Shebar Janala lies in its fusion of grassroots citizen empowerment with cutting-edge digital tools. While Bangladesh has pioneered G2P digital payments, most existing systems are transactional rather than participatory. They digitize money flow but leave citizens without voice or visibility. Our approach bridges this gap by integrating bottom-up problem reporting with top-down transparency dashboards.

1. Citizen Voice at Scale – Unlike most safety-net systems that operate unilaterally, Shebar Janala allows citizens to report problems, attach geotagged photos, and endorse neighbors’ issues. This participatory design turns citizens into real-time auditors.


2. Blockchain Transparency – While blockchain has been piloted in financial inclusion, its application in social protection ledgering is new. Every allowance payment, relief package, or rice disbursement is logged immutably, preventing tampering by local intermediaries.


3. AI Routing & Fraud Detection – The platform uses AI for natural language processing (Bangla) and anomaly detection. Complaints are automatically tagged (e.g., infrastructure vs. welfare distribution), reducing administrative bottlenecks. Fraud signals such as duplicate NIDs or unusual distributions are flagged proactively.


4. Inclusion via USSD/SMS – Recognizing the 41% urban vs. 26% rural smartphone penetration, Shebar Janala ensures access through low-tech channels. This inclusivity is a differentiator that makes it viable for both urban poor and rural communities.


5. Multi-stakeholder Dashboards – Separate dashboards for Union Parishads, Upazila officials, and donors ensure layered accountability. Local leaders see KPIs, donors track fund utilization, and citizens verify entitlements.



In short, Shebar Janala is not just a digital payment tracker — it is a holistic ecosystem where transparency, citizen engagement, and institutional oversight converge.","Shebar Janala’s features are designed to be simple for citizens yet powerful for administrators:

Citizen Portal (Amar Sheba) – Citizens report problems using text, voice, or photos. Issues are geo-tagged and verified through NID. Neighbors can “endorse” issues, creating community prioritization.

Beneficiary Passport (Protiva) – Every eligible citizen receives a digital ID that tracks entitlements and payments. Accessible via app, SMS, or USSD, this passport ensures transparency at the individual level.

Leader Dashboard – Union/Upazila officials track disbursement rates, unresolved complaints, and fraud alerts. Tools allow merging duplicate complaints and generating ward-wise heatmaps.

Donor Dashboard – NGOs and multilateral agencies track impact, monitor anomalies, and verify that funds reach intended recipients.

AI Engine – Automates classification of complaints (e.g., social security, relief, infrastructure), filters spam/abuse, and flags fraud.

Blockchain Ledger – Anchors every transaction, creating a shared source of truth across government and citizens.

USSD/SMS Access – Ensures that even without smartphones, citizens can check eligibility or log complaints.


Together, these modules deliver a full transparency cycle: reporting → verification → logging → oversight → resolution.","At its core, Shebar Janala is a civic-tech innovation powered by AI, blockchain, and mobile accessibility.

Artificial Intelligence:

Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Bangla enables citizens to report issues in plain text or voice.

Computer Vision validates photo evidence (e.g., diverted rice sacks).

Anomaly Detection identifies ghost beneficiaries, duplicate payments, or suspicious clusters.

AI Telephony enables interactive voice response (IVR) in Bangla, ensuring accessibility for low-literacy users.


Blockchain:

A permissioned blockchain (Hyperledger/Ethereum hybrid) ensures tamper-proof disbursement logs.

Every allowance or relief payment is immutably recorded, visible to both government and citizens.

Enhances trust by preventing retroactive manipulation.


Geospatial Tech:

H3 geospatial indexing + PostGIS enables ward-wise dashboards and anomaly mapping.

Ensures precise targeting during disasters or localized fraud events.


Accessibility Features:

USSD/SMS fallback ensures participation from feature-phone users.

Bangla-first UI/UX lowers barriers for elderly and rural citizens.

","The Automated Medication Management and Assistive Unit (AMMAU) is a modular smart dispenser designed to help elderly patients manage complex medication schedules. It features guided setup through a touchscreen and provides both on-screen and voice prompts for scheduled doses. Using IR sensors, it detects when a hand approaches a slot, announces the medication and dosage, and, after a simple Yes/No confirmation, logs intake and updates inventory. Caregivers receive real-time alerts for low stock. For insulin users, an embedded ML module predicts basal doses based on fasting glucose and body weight, offering a cross-check against the physician’s plan to flag unusual deviations. This ensures timely dosing, reduces errors, maintains accurate records, and eases the burden on families and caregivers.","Most solutions separate tasks: pill dispensers manage medications while apps handle insulin calculations. AMMAU brings both together, integrating multi-medication dispensing with AI-driven basal insulin guidance in a single device and interface. Each insulin dose is paired with simple health inputs, such as fasting glucose and weight, providing safer, context-aware prompts now and valuable trend tracking over time. Designed for real homes and low-resource settings, it combines a touch interface, IR sensing, voice alerts, caregiver notifications, and offline-first functionality, ensuring reliable dosing even without internet access. A key differentiator is its power resilience: a 9V DC primary supply with automatic failover to a 10,000 mAh internal battery and a low-power mode that extends runtime during outages. The insulin prediction model, trained on a 9,672-record clinically validated dataset, achieves an R² of ~0.96 and runs fully on-device for fast, private recommendations. One unit. One seamless workflow.","●	Modular capacity: The unit can be built with 4 to 20 slots in a compact 46 × 37 × 6.5 cm box that is small enough for a bedside table, big enough for a full regimen.
●	Simple setup on touch screen: Use Set Box to name each slot and enter the starting quantity. Use Set Schedule to add medicine names, doses, and times. The system groups meds taken at the same time, so nothing is missed.
●	Reminders: At the right time, the screen shows exactly what to take, and the speaker reads it out. If a dose is missed, caregivers get a notification. The device asks, “Taken?”. A quick Yes/No confirms the dose.
●	Automatic adherence log: Every confirmed and missed dose is time-stamped and saved. You can export reports for a doctor visit or share with family.
●	Live inventory tracking: The system counts pills as you go and sends early low-stock alerts so you can refill before you run out.
●	AI help for insulin (basal): Enter fasting glucose (mg/dL or mmol/L) and body weight (kg). The on-device model suggests a basal insulin dose (units) and flags unusual differences from your usual plan so you can double-check with your doctor.
●	Made for elders: Large text, high contrast, and Bangla/English on both screen and voice prompts keep it accessible.
●	Clear roles and records: Separate patient and caregiver profiles, complete with timestamps and an audit trail for accountability.
●	Built-in safety: Optional lockout windows can prevent accidental extra doses. Each slot has tamper detection.
●	Connected, but works offline: You get email/app alerts when connected. If the internet goes down, core dosing still works.
●	Power: Normally runs on 9 V DC. During a power cut, it automatically switches to the 10,000 mAh internal battery and enters low-power mode (dimmed screen, batched alerts) to stretch runtime.
","●	Hardware: Runs a Linux system on Raspberry Pi 4, with a 7” touchscreen, IR sensors on every slot, and a speaker for clear prompts, inside a compact, wipe-clean tabletop enclosure.
●	Software: The Django app handles the UI, schedules, logs, and inventory. A separate Flask service runs the ML model. Data lives in a local database, and caregiver notifications are sent securely.
●	AI module: Basal-insulin prediction was tested with KNN, MLR, and LightGBM. Models were trained on a 9,672-record, medically benchmarked synthetic dataset. The top model achieved R² ≥ 0.96 with low MAE and runs on-device with guardrails and human-in-the-loop checks.
●	Reliability engineering: Debounced sensor reads prevent false triggers. Structured med/dose records, startup self-tests, and a watchdog with safe defaults help the system recover from glitches. If the network is down, the notifications queue is sent later.
●	Data & safety: Time-stamped adherence logs, configurable thresholds, and exportable reports support clinician review.
●	Power architecture: Power-path management switches to the 10,000 mAh internal battery in <10 ms. The 9 V input is protected (reverse/over-voltage) and smart-charged.
●	Battery optimization: On battery, a low-power governor, adaptive backlight, sensor duty-cycling, and batched/quieter audio extend runtime. Coulomb counting reports state of charge/health with on-screen runtime estimates.

Member 3: Arman Hossain (UIU)","In many rural areas, farmers still rely on traditional methods passed down through generations. They often cannot read or write, and many do not own smartphones. When pests spread, soil becomes weak, or sudden weather changes occur, they have no reliable way of knowing what action to take. A single wrong decision can destroy their entire harvest, leaving families in debt and communities struggling with food shortages.
AgriSense was born to solve this problem. It is a low-cost system that uses small sensors placed in the farmland to track soil moisture, pH, temperature, crop health and other data. This information is sent to a server without internet, where AI analyzes the data and generates simple, practical advice. It suggests both natural remedies and professional solutions considering all the factors for the farmland and crops.  Farmers then receive SMS messages or automated phone calls in their local language telling them what to do—whether it’s to irrigate, add nutrients, or prepare for heavy rain. It also has web-app support for a more detailed dashboard and features in case someone needs to use it. 
But AgriSense goes further. Farmers without smartphones can call a number and speak directly with an AI assistant in their local language, asking about crop problems and receiving instant solutions. The system also integrates weather forecasts and market prices, so farmers not only protect their crops but also know the best time to sell them.
Beyond individual support, AgriSense enables farmer-to-farmer knowledge sharing. A farmer can record their problem by voice, which the system translates and shares with experts or other farmers who have faced similar issues. Meanwhile, policymakers and NGOs can monitor the dashboard, gaining real-time insights into pest outbreaks, drought-prone zones, or communities needing urgent help. Also they get realtime market price update to be protected from low price. Also they can sell their project. All available by calling.
With AgriSense, farmers no longer have to farm in the dark. They get timely guidance, their yields increase, losses decrease, and rural communities grow stronger. By bridging modern technology with local culture, this project gives every farmer—whether literate or not—the power to farm smarter, feed more people, and secure a better future.
","AgriSense is unique because it makes modern agricultural intelligence accessible without requiring internet, literacy, or smartphones. Unlike most smart farming systems that target large commercial farms, AgriSense is designed for rural smallholder farmers with minimal resources. It combines low-cost IoT sensors, AI analysis, and voice/SMS delivery in local languages, ensuring even illiterate farmers can receive and act on scientific advice. Its farmer-to-farmer voice knowledge sharing and policy dashboard also create a full ecosystem where individuals, communities, and governments all benefit together.","IoT Sensors: Soil moisture, pH, temperature, crop health monitoring.

AI-Powered Analysis: Converts raw data into simple, practical recommendations.

Offline Data Transfer: Works without internet; server collects and processes locally.

Multi-Channel Guidance: Farmers receive advice via SMS, automated calls, or live voice assistant in their local language.

Weather & Market Integration: Forecast alerts and real-time market price updates.

Farmer Knowledge Sharing: Farmers record problems by voice; the system translates and connects them to experts or peers.

Dashboard for Policymakers/NGOs: Real-time insights into pest outbreaks, drought-prone areas, and community needs.","AgriSense applies a hybrid of IoT, AI, and telecommunication technologies in an innovative way:

IoT ensures accurate field data collection.

AI transforms data into actionable, context-aware advice tailored for each crop and condition.

Telecom Integration (SMS & IVR) breaks the literacy and smartphone barrier, delivering guidance to every farmer.

","Quadruped robots are one of the important platforms in the field of mobile robotics, as they offer enhanced mobility and impressive stability over the complex terrain. These capabilities make the quadruped highly suitable for military operations, industrial applications, and assistance in disaster scenarios. The focus of this research is to design and development of an 8-degree-of-freedom (8-DoF) quadruped robot with the objectives of enhancing the design architecture, optimizing the distribution of joint torques, and improved gait design. The operational framework emphasizes combining 3D modelling to ensure optimal weight distribution, torque analyses, uniform actuator control, and comprehensive gait analyses. The developed prototype is capable of adapting locomotion showing its stability in balancing. It also demonstrates stable and versatile movements across a wide range of indoor terrains. Experimental results indicate its reliability and applicability in critical environments. Applications such as search-and-rescue, would potentially benefit from this stabilized modes of motion.","The project stands out in its coupled and combined solution to some of the biggest issues of quadruped robotics in a moderate-DOF setting. Although many works deal with individual aspects, this thesis integrates several key fields that are not usually tackled together for 8-DOF systems.
Some of the key unique points are:
Integrated Design Framework: The project combines, for the first time, mechanical design optimization, advanced control methodologies, intelligent motion planning, and real-time adaptive control into a single integrated framework.
Emphasis on Moderate-DOF Systems: A majority of the state-of-the-art research is directed towards high-DOF or soft robots. This work exactly bridges the void in 8-DOF platforms, which sacrifice mechanical complexity for control tractability, by addressing synchronization between gait type and torque distribution for improved energy efficiency.
Torque-Aware Gait Control: Unlike the naive gait scheduling of other designs, this project performs a detailed torque analysis to ensure that the chosen actuators (servo motors) can manage the physical demands, preventing overload and failure. This analysis directly informs the motion planning and control strategy.
","The quadruped robot is a functional prototype with a range of features for stable locomotion and control.
Core Functionality:
Locomotion: The robot can perform stable walking and turning motions using fundamental gait patterns like crawl and trot.
Coordinated Movement: Coordinated movement is realized through independent control of all eight joints (two per leg: one hip, one knee) in a manner to facilitate smooth movement.
Dynamic Balance: An ADXL345 accelerometer provides real-time orientation data to the control system, which can sense tilt or sudden movement and provide urgency corrections to balance.
Wireless Control: Wireless communication is provided through an HC-05 module, allowing remote control and receipt of commands.
Key Features:
Control System: A centralized control system is run by an Arduino Uno microcontroller. It reads sensor data and sends commands to the motors.
Actuation: Movement is provided by nine MG995/MG996R high-torque servo motors, eight of which are utilized for the leg joints and one of which may be utilized for accessory functions like a camera.
Power Management: A PCA9685 Servo Driver precisely controls all servos, offloading the main processor and delivering a stable power supply to the motors.
Modular Physical Structure: The robot's chassis and leg pieces were developed using 3D modeling and manufactured using lightweight materials like PLA or ABS, offering a balance of strength, low inertia, and manufacturability.","The quality is ensured by a systematic and disciplined engineering process:
Simulation and Modeling: A 3D model in fine detail was created to visualize the robot structure, simulate the range of motion, and optimize the mechanical design before physical assembly.

Data-Driven Analysis: The design does not rely on arbitrary guesswork but is built on the foundation of quantitative torque analysis. Calculations were made to determine the exact torque demand of the hip (1.47 Nm) and knee (0.735 Nm) joints, substantiating the fact that the MG995/MG996R motors chosen (~1.6-1.8 Nm) would be sufficient.

Systematic Testing: The robot's walking sequences and motions were tested experimentally and documented with images and data tables, substantiating the success of the gait patterns that had been executed.


The project effectively employs affordable and accessible technology to achieve its goals:
Microcontroller and Drivers: Arduino Uno and PCA9685 servo driver are an effective and popular pair to drive multiple servos for robotics, and this allows the design to be reproducible and low-cost.
3D Printing: Physical development of the robot was created using 3D printing, which allowed for rapid prototyping and the creation of light, custom-designed parts.

Real-World Scenarios: The technology is designed for high-stakes, real-world use in applications where mobility in difficult environments is paramount. These include:

●	Search and Rescue / Disaster Response
●	Industrial Inspection and Automation
●	Defense and Military Reconnaissance
●	Environmental Monitoring

Advisor (Mentor): Md. Moshiur Rahman – Faculty Mentor, Department of Software Engineering, BDU","SmartTrafficAI is an AI-powered adaptive traffic signal control system designed to solve Bangladesh’s growing urban congestion problem. Unlike traditional fixed-time or manually operated signals, our solution uses real-time computer vision and deep reinforcement learning to dynamically optimize traffic light timings based on actual road conditions.

The system deploys low-cost surveillance cameras at intersections, where a custom-trained YOLOv8 model detects and classifies vehicles, measuring queue lengths, density, and speed. This data is processed by a Dynamic Weight-based Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (DWMORA) algorithm, which continuously learns and adapts signal timing to minimize waiting times, reduce fuel consumption, and cut carbon emissions.

To ensure scalability, the system integrates a Coordinated Adjacent Intersection Approach (CAIA). This allows intersections to self-coordinate in a decentralized manner, avoiding heavy communication infrastructure costs. By doing so, SmartTrafficAI can be deployed city-wide, even in resource-constrained environments like Dhaka.

Our solution has been tested in traffic simulation platforms (SUMO, CityFlow) and is being prepared for real-world pilot deployment in Dhaka intersections. Results show significant improvements in reducing delays and congestion compared to conventional methods.

Beyond congestion management, SmartTrafficAI has the potential to prioritize emergency vehicles and public transport, improving response times and service efficiency. In the future, it can also integrate pedestrian and bicycle flows to create a comprehensive smart mobility ecosystem.

By combining affordability, AI-driven intelligence, and real-world adaptability, SmartTrafficAI directly supports the Smart Bangladesh 2041 vision, contributing to safer, greener, and more efficient urban transportation.","SmartTrafficAI is unique because it is the first Bangladesh-focused AI-powered traffic management solution that combines affordability, scalability, and real-time adaptability. Unlike traditional fixed-time signals or imported smart systems that rely on costly sensors and centralized infrastructure, SmartTrafficAI uses low-cost cameras with YOLOv8 computer vision for real-time vehicle detection and traffic flow measurement, making it practical for local deployment.

Its Dynamic Weight-based Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (DWMORA) algorithm balances multiple goals—reducing waiting time, cutting fuel waste, and lowering emissions—rather than optimizing only a single factor. Additionally, the Coordinated Adjacent Intersection Approach (CAIA) enables intersections to self-coordinate without heavy communication infrastructure, making large-scale city-wide deployment feasible in resource-constrained environments.

Another key differentiator is that the system is custom-built for Dhaka’s mixed and unpredictable traffic, unlike many international solutions designed for structured Western roads. This ensures real-world applicability and direct impact in the Bangladeshi context.

By combining AI innovation, local adaptability, and sustainability, SmartTrafficAI stands out as a low-cost yet high-impact solution that directly contributes to Bangladesh’s Smart City and Smart Bangladesh 2041 vision.","SmartTrafficAI functions as a real-time adaptive traffic signal control system that continuously learns and responds to changing road conditions. Its operation is built on three core layers: perception, intelligence, and coordination.

At the perception level, YOLOv8 computer vision enables accurate, real-time vehicle detection, speed estimation, and traffic density measurement from low-cost surveillance cameras. This eliminates the need for expensive physical sensors, ensuring affordability and scalability for cities like Dhaka.

At the decision-making level, the system uses a Dynamic Weight-based Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (DWMORA) algorithm. Unlike traditional single-objective models, DWMORA balances multiple factors—reducing delays, minimizing queues, cutting fuel usage, and lowering emissions. This ensures optimized performance even under Bangladesh’s chaotic and mixed-traffic conditions.

At the coordination level, Coordinated Adjacent Intersection Approach (CAIA) allows decentralized communication-free synchronization between intersections.

","My father is a farmer who works diligently in the morning and evening.  I encountered an issue last winter when I visited my village. Most of our employees were on holiday, so I worked diligently with my father to feed poultry, which was hard work and time-consuming. The number of poultry farms in the area is approximately 1200, and the process of feeding and watering the chickens is both time-consuming and challenging.  Additionally, employing a large number of laborers to manage the many chickens is costly.  Additionally, it is contingent upon the weather and temperature. 
A 2024 statistic indicates that the poultry industry in Bangladesh employs 9 million individuals.  Bangladesh is home to approximately 75,000 to 150,000 poultry farms, as indicated by government and private sources.  This rate is increasing at an average rate of 15% annually. 
I have identified numerous solutions to this issue thus far; however, the systems that have been developed are based on a structural framework and have not yet been customized to accommodate small businesses, which is a costly endeavor. Therefore, I devised a solution that will reduce labor usage by approximately 40 to 50%, provide observation data, foretell weather conditions, and, of course, save costs. Additionally, it will save time during the process of feeding and watering.  
This project introduces a smart weather monitoring and management system for poultry farming that is based on the Internet of Things (IoT). The system is intended to enhance productivity, reduce labor, and enhance animal welfare by engaging in real-time monitoring and automation.  By employing a combination of microcontrollers and sensors, the system continuously monitors critical environmental variables within the poultry house, including temperature, humidity, light intensity, and moisture.  Predicting daily environmental conditions using all real-time data for performance monitoring and historical analysis further enhances the system's intelligence. All sensor data can be accessed via Wi-Fi on smartphones or web browsers.
","1. The system integrates real-time automation, predictive weather analytics, and remote access into a single, cost-effective platform tailored for poultry farming.
2. Unlike traditional systems that rely on manual control or fixed automation, this solution uses real-time environmental feedback to adaptively manage farm operations.
3. It includes cloud-linked data logging via Google Sheets, enabling:
   - Live updates of sensor data
   - Long-term trend analysis

4. A Python-based weather prediction module leverages historical data to deliver accurate forecasts, enhancing the system's decision-making capabilities.
5. This combination of intelligent automation, remote monitoring, and predictive analytics at a low cost is rarely available in existing agricultural solutions.

","Real-Time Monitoring: Continuously tracks temperature, humidity, light intensity, and soil moisture using high-precision sensors.

Automated Control: Uses microcontroller-driven logic to manage fans, lights, water pumps, and feeders based on sensor input.

Remote Accessibility: All system data is accessible via mobile and web dashboards, enabling 24/7 remote supervision.

Data Logging: Automatically logs sensor data to Google Sheets for historical tracking and performance analysis.

Alert System: Sends real-time notifications when environmental conditions exceed acceptable thresholds.

Machine Learning Integration: A Python-based module predicts future weather conditions, allowing proactive environmental adjustments.

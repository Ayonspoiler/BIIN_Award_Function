The platform helps taxpayers submit their returns online without visiting physical tax centers. By streamlining the tax process, it saves time and resources. The system also enhances tax data sharing and improves compliance by making the process more accessible and efficient. More than 1.8 million people have submitted their return through e-Return system so far. After the implementation of e-Return, there was 300% increase in return submission. Also, it has been made mandatory from this financial year to submit returns through e-Return for 2.6+ million return registers. ","e-Return is the only tax return submission platform of Bangladesh.

After being a mother, in the Bangladeshi context, it gets harder to continue job with the process of upbringing a child. My project proposes a solution to this problem. As an architecture student, I intend to design an institution where 0-6 years old child will get a safe place to spend, as well as they will get to spend their time with playful learning. Child friendly environment will be integrated, as well as this Institution will be a great learning hub which will work as daycare, pre-school, kindergarten at the same time.
This project will solve the problem of keeping child in a safe place where they will learn and grow with other children while working class women will get to work.
Since this daycare procedure is least common in bangladeshi context, so my project will propose a solution which is that, a safe place will be created for infants to toddlers and children who will learn and grow and this type of institution will get normalized and wholeheartedly accepted. Thus, working class women won't have to leave their jobs after giving births.","This kind of institution is not available currently in Bangladesh where infant to 6yo child gets a safe place with integrated learning methods to stay while their guardian work without any hesitation or tension. So this project will connect a daycare,pre-school and kindergarten altogether so that different age group kids can roam around and grow playfully and innovatively out of the traditional learning process.","Main functionality will be providing 0-6year old children safe and caregiving place. 
Other features are:
-It will have proper playing spaces separately that will help improving their sensory characteristics.
-It will have sleeping spaces, activity spaces, group work nooks, playing areas in nature like mud, clay, water ect. 
-Infants will have safe and care-giving space like home.
-The way age will increase they will be moved to different sections of the institutions according to their age's need.
-Not same as traditional learning institution.
-All the learnings will be achieved through playing.
Not traditional classroom culture which scares toddlers and children to attend their classes.","The whole space design will be achieved through technology. Since it is costly and not possible to experiment to build a institution and then decide whether it is functional. 
So 3D modeling softwares like sketchup,. Rhino will be used in 3D designing and visualisation. 
Autocad(software) will be used in planning the spaces.
V-ray, enscape(softwares) will be used to visualise the actual space with realistic render that will help to visualise the real institution. Thus technology will be used to visualise the imagination in reality.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No

A proactive learner with proven success in national competitions and a strong drive for innovation.","I, Md. Rezoan Khan, am the student leader behind the development of AgriEye. Even though I am the main developer, I have worked with mentors and peers to get their opinions on AI implementation and agricultural challenges. Research, software integration, testing, and model development (YOLOv8) are all part of my job. Currently a solo endeavor, there is potential for future growth into a startup or larger team.","Most farmers in Bangladesh do not have any institutional education in agriculture. Almost all of them adopt this profession through inheritance. As a result, they continue farming in traditional ways. They often make decisions by imitating other farmers. They are not well aware of the different types of crop diseases. Sometimes, without any real necessity, they use various chemicals just by following others. Consequently, crop production is often hampered, desired yields are not achieved, and health risks are created. We are proposing AgriEye as a smart and futuristic solution to this problem. AgriEye is an AI-powered smart mini drone that flies over crops, scans them, and detects various existing diseases. It then generates a smart report covering the entire field. The report will include necessary remedies and preventive measures.
Based on the current condition of the leaves, our futuristic mini drone will also be able to provide information about potential upcoming diseases.
In short, it will become a blessing for farmers. It can provide detailed information about areas of the field that are hard for humans to reach directly. As a result, unnecessary pesticide use will be avoided, and overall production will increase.","As of today, there is no AI-powered mini drone system or even standalone AI-based solution being used in the agricultural sector in Bangladesh for disease detection. And certainly, no such system is being produced commercially.
Globally, a few major brands use large-sized drones for various agricultural tasks—such as spraying pesticides, fertilizers, and even disease detection. However, due to their multifunctional design, these drones become significantly large and expensive, often costing between $25,000 to $30,000 on average.
In contrast, our proposal is to develop a dedicated mini drone focused solely on crop disease detection. This drone will be compact, lightweight, and significantly more affordable. Based on our preliminary estimates, we believe we can produce each unit within $250 to $300, making it a highly cost-effective and unique solution compared to existing global offerings.
It can also be able to monitor soil quality and weather condition of the field and give a proper instruction to farmer.","Some special features of our mini drone are:
1. Realtime monitoring and live detection.
2. Low hardware requirements
3. Exclusive report with efficient solution
4. Soil and weather condition monitoring
5. Effective for multiple crops","AgriEye uses cutting-edge deep learning technology (YOLOv8) to identify diseases in real time. The model was fine-tuned for high accuracy on local disease conditions using datasets of rice leaves. Because of its efficiency and portability, the system can be installed on inexpensive IoT boards, smartphones, or regular laptops. AgriEye bridges the gap between cutting-edge research and real-world farming needs by implementing AI in agriculture. Its use directly supports national food security goals by ensuring early detection, decreased losses, and sustainable crop management.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

Rezwanul Islam Shuvo,Founder and CEO,1521506189,rzshuvo001@gmail.com,,Md. Rezwanul Islam Shuvo,rzshuvo001@gmail.com," It all began in the muddy, flood-ravaged fields of Bangladesh's southwest coast, where families watched their livelihoods slip away with every rising tide. Salty soil choked crops, water stood useless, and hope faded like the barren land. That’s when Eco Sentinels Bangladesh emerged - not from a boardroom, but from a bold idea born during a competition entry. We couldn’t ignore the suffering of coastal families. With our own savings and sheer determination, we built the first floating bed by hand. No investors, no fanfare - just belief and science.
Today, we stand as Eco Sentinels Bangladesh, a youth-powered force inspired by nature and driven by innovation. Our motto, ""Inspired by Nature, Driven by Innovation,"" guides us. We aim to spark change from the ground up, crafting nature-based solutions to combat salinity, floods, and pollution. This isn’t just about profit; it’s about uplifting lives. We bridge local wisdom with fresh ideas, empowering women, youth, and communities to build resilience. Our vision? A Bangladesh where harvests thrive, communities endure climate challenges, and nature leads. With our flagship project, Harvesting Resilience, we’ve already made waves. Now, we partner with NGOs, schools, and locals to scale this impact. It’s a mission to keep roots strong and hope afloat.","Our team feels like a family shaped by the fields - diverse, passionate, and relentless. Each member brings a personal story that fuels our mission. Meet the heartbeats of Eco Sentinels.
Md. Rezwanul Islam Shuvo, our Founder and CEO, leads with vision and action. Holding a BSc in Environmental Science from Khulna University, he roots his work in field research and climate policy. He talks to farmers, turns ideas into reality, and ensures innovation works. Those first floating beds? He built them, driven by the pain in coastal eyes. For him, floating agriculture is a proven playground, not a trial.
Antora Das, Co-Founder and Chief Impact Community Officer, turns empathy into impact. As an undergraduate in Development Studies at Khulna University, she blends academic insight with field experience. She crafts stories and strategies that inspire change, focusing on climate justice, gender equity, and disaster resilience. Antora believes, “No development works without listening to people.” She keeps our work grounded in community needs, mobilizing voices that matter.
Shabbir Ahammad, our COO, thrives in the mud. An Environmental Science student at Khulna University, he tackles climate challenges with research and engagement. Through Harvesting Resilience, he pioneers nature-based farming. As Exhibition Secretary of the Khulna University Photography Society, he uses creativity to raise awareness. Shabbir fixes beds, tests soil, and turns setbacks into solutions - our fieldwork engine.
Sadia Ishrat Nisa, Chief Sustainability Officer, connects science and practice. With a BSc in Civil Engineering from the Military Institute of Science and Technology and an MBA from Bangladesh University of Professionals, she currently serves as a Research Coordinator at Tetra. Her passion lies in water, environment, and climate solutions for marginalized communities. Sadia balances impact with data, speaking both farmer and business languages to ensure sustainability.
Md. Robiul Hossain, Head of Creative Content, brings visuals to life. An Economics student with over two years as a Graphic and UX/UI Designer, he’s worked with 100+ businesses to create impactful designs. He channels his environmental passion into graphics and branding, making our story resonate before words are spoken.
We’re guided by mentors like Prof. Dr. Md. Sanaul Islam and Prof. Dr. Abdullah Harun Chowdhury from Khulna University. Their wisdom steadies us as we’ve claimed titles like Youth Startup Summit 2025 Champion and Oxfam’s Social Innovation award. Our wins shine, but our real triumph is the lives we touch.","In Bangladesh’s coastal areas, rising salinity and floods are making farming nearly impossible. Small farmers lose crops year after year. With more than 1.056 million hectares of land facing saltation, Many leave the land or switch to harmful shrimp farming, which worsens the soil. This hits poor families hardest (10 million), especially women (more than 24%), who depend on farming for food and income. We build low-cost floating beds that grow food in flooded or salty lands. Each bed uses agro-waste like water hyacinth, bamboo, coco-peat and our main weapon against salinity is halophytes, which reduces salinity. To boost desalinization, we combine halophyte phytoremediation with our nature-based media, cutting salinity by up to 66%. Unlike typical floating farms, our beds grow crops like paddy and wheat with 30% higher yield. Additionally, unlike traditional farming, our floating bed agriculture emits 95% less greenhouse gases like methane and carbon dioxide. Local women are trained as micro-entrepreneurs to build, sell, and support the beds. This creates jobs and helps farmers adopt the solution. Each bed lasts 15 years, cutting long-term costs. Farmers can keep farming despite floods or salt intrusion, reducing income loss and migration. We also work with NGOs and schools to spread awareness and train youth. Using local tools and materials keeps costs low and helps the community own the process.
","What sets us apart is simple, there’s nothing quite like this out there. No venture in Bangladesh and in the world can offer this much integrated solution where without any major interventions we can reduce and adapt climate smart agriculture through nature based approach. While traditional floating beds barely survive 6 months and only grow small vegetables, our nature-based innovation supports staple crops like rice and wheat, even in harsh saline zones, and can last up to 15 years. No heavy engineering. No synthetic input. Just science, nature, and community.
Our floating bed media reduces salinity by up to 40–50% and has shown potential to increase yields by 30%. That’s not a claim—it’s backed by field pilots and community feedback. All of this at just $6 per bag, needing only 7 bags for a 20ft x 5ft bed. Affordable. Scalable. Additionally, unlike traditional farming, our floating bed agriculture emits 95% less greenhouse gases like methane and carbon dioxide
But tech alone doesn't solve problems. That’s why we operate through a woman-led micro-entrepreneurship model bringing services like training and consultation directly to the farmers. Women earn. Farmers grow. Communities thrive.
No existing solution delivers this level of resilience, crop performance, and livelihood impact all while being eco-friendly and community-driven. This isn’t just a product. It’s a quiet shift toward equity, sustainability, and survival.

Expertise: Bridges AI-driven software with reliable, secure hardware for resource-constrained platforms","Bangladesh’s complaint system traps citizens in cycles of delay, corruption, and neglect. People like Rima fear their evidence will be tampered with. Rafiq fears bribes will decide his case. Over half of complaints, 50.9 percent, are ignored entirely. The average case drags on for 5.3 years. Backlogs swell to 4.29 million cases with 150,000 investigations pending. Complaint follow-ups fail in 91.5 percent of cases. Corruption spreads across vital services, from passports at 86 percent to healthcare at 49 percent, draining 10,902 crore taka from households each year.

Our solution is a blockchain-based digital complaint platform. Citizens register complaints online. Artificial intelligence identifies the correct department and analyzes complaint metadata. The system notifies the responsible authority immediately. The authority verifies, requests details if needed, resolves the complaint, and replies. Higher authorities and ministries are notified at each step. The citizen confirms resolution. The entire record remains active and tamper-proof on blockchain.

This process reduces ignored complaints, prevents evidence tampering, and enforces accountability. AI speeds up assignment and reduces bias. Blockchain ensures transparency and trust. Automatic notifications to higher levels limit delays. User confirmation makes outcomes citizen-centered. With this system, citizens like Rima and Rafiq would see real-time progress, secure records, and faster resolutions without bribes or bias.","QuickSolve is unique because it goes far beyond existing platforms like the Government’s Grievance Redress System (GRS), the Consumer Complaint Management System (CCMS) of DNCRP, and Transparency International Bangladesh’s Report Corruption (RC). Where these systems often fall short, QuickSolve introduces blockchain to secure all records and evidence, ensuring they remain tamper-proof and permanently verifiable. It integrates artificial intelligence to analyze complaints and route them quickly to the right department, cutting down the years of delay that plague traditional systems. Unlike other platforms, QuickSolve guarantees user anonymity, encouraging citizens to raise complaints without fear of retaliation, and it links directly with judicial bodies for rapid escalation when necessary.

The platform is designed for accessibility through both web and mobile applications, making it easy for citizens across different regions to use, in contrast to the limited digital availability of its competitors. It keeps users informed with real-time progress tracking, solving the common frustration of failed follow-ups, and builds trust by requiring users to confirm resolutions before closing any case. This citizen-centered design, powered by technology and transparency, makes QuickSolve not just another complaint management system but a transformative solution that ensures accountability and restores faith in public grievance redress.","* *Blockchain security*

The frontend, built with WAGMI and React.js, offers a simple and accessible interface that allows citizens such as Rima and Rafiq to submit and track complaints without difficulty. This user-friendly experience is supported by a backend developed with Node.js and Express, ensuring smooth server-side operations and reliable API integration.

At the core of the platform is the blockchain layer, operating on a decentralized system that guarantees tamper-proof storage of evidence. This directly addresses data manipulation issues common in the current complaint process. Smart contracts, built with Solidity and managed through Hardhat, automate the rules of complaint handling, removing opportunities for bias and reducing procedural delays. By interacting with the blockchain, these contracts ensure immutable records and trustworthy outcomes.

For off-chain storage, the system uses IPFS, the InterPlanetary File System, which provides decentralized and secure data storage. This off-chain solution connects with on-chain smart contracts to strike a balance between efficiency and scalability. The backend also integrates Firebase and MongoDB for real-time management and persistent storage of data, enhancing responsiveness and operational reliability.

The governance flow begins with a user submitting a complaint through the React interface, which triggers API calls to the Express backend. Client-side JavaScript operations using web3.js interact with the smart contracts, which then execute blockchain transactions. Data is stored in IPFS and managed through Firebase and MongoDB. Each step of this workflow, from submission to resolution, is transparent, auditable, and resistant to corruption.

This integrated system directly addresses key issues such as the 50.9 percent complaint ignore rate and the 5.3-year average case duration. It supports unique features like anonymity, judicial integration, and real-time tracking, ensuring that complaints are handled quickly and fairly. By combining decentralized technologies with modern backend and frontend frameworks, QuickSolve offers a reliable and accountable solution to break through the inefficiencies and corruption of the existing system.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No

Nodi AI replaces all of this with one dashboard where businesses can:

1. Capture leads from multiple channels (WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, Email).

2. Reply instantly with AI trained on their company data.

3. Send quotations, invoices, and get paid inside chat.

4. Set reminders and track deal stages with automation.

By simplifying lead-to-deal workflows, Nodi AI saves businesses hours of manual work and prevents lost revenue from missed opportunities.","All-in-One Flow: Unlike traditional CRMs, Nodi AI covers the full chain — lead capture → instant AI replies → quoting → invoicing → payment.

AI with Memory: AI assistants today give generic replies. Nodi AI trains on each business’s unique services, tone, FAQs, and pricing, making replies human-like and relevant.

Service-Focused: Most tools target e-commerce or enterprise. Nodi AI is built specifically for service providers (real estate, interior firms, agencies) — a market underserved by global SaaS.

Made in Bangladesh, Built for Scale: Entire design, dev, and R&D done locally, but with global scalability in mind.","Nodi AI provides an end-to-end solution for service businesses to manage leads and close deals:

Unified Inbox: Connect WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, and Email into one dashboard.

AI Auto-Replies: AI trained on each business’s FAQs, tone, and pricing to respond instantly to leads.

Quotations & Invoices in Chat: Create and send documents directly inside conversations with edit options.

So in that land we will establish solar panel with water reservour.From that we will get huge amount power from that solution.We will supply this electricity to the community and industries.
We will collect the rain water and this use for harvesting and producing electricity.
From the rain water , we will produce electricity and then supply to the community.
As a result,if the sun light would not shown or in rainy season we will produce electricity from that water."," 1. Dual Land Use Efficiency

Agrivoltaics allows for simultaneous use of land for solar power generation and agriculture, effectively increasing land productivity. Adding a rainwater reservoir enhances this by introducing water security, particularly in water-scarce areas.



 2. Rainwater Harvesting as a Sustainable Water Source

The presence of solar panels creates an ideal infrastructure to collect rainwater, which is then stored in a reservoir:

Runoff from solar panels can be channeled efficiently.

Reduces dependence on groundwater or external water sources.

Ensures a sustainable irrigation source, especially during dry seasons.



 3. Microclimate Modification Enhances Crop Yield

The shade from solar panels:

Lowers soil temperature and evaporation.

Retains moisture, reducing irrigation needs.

Combined with a water reservoir, this creates a self-sustaining microclimate ideal for growing crops, even in semi-arid regions.



 4. Energy-Water-Food Nexus

This system embodies the energy-water-food nexus:

Energy: Solar PV generates clean power.

Water: Rainwater harvesting ensures irrigation.

Food: Crops thrive under controlled microclimatic conditions. This interconnection enhances resilience and resource efficiency.



 5. Climate Resilience and Carbon Reduction

Supports adaptation to climate variability (droughts, heatwaves).

Reduces carbon footprint by producing local food and clean energy.

Limits water usage, aligning with climate-smart agriculture goals.
6. Customizable for Various Scales and Terrains

Ideal for small farms to large agribusinesses.

Can be adapted to hilly, arid, or marginal lands.

Reservoir size and solar array can be tailored to the crop and rainfall pattern.

 7. Economic Diversification

Farmers gain multiple revenue streams:

Selling solar energy.

Crop production.

Possibly water access for nearby communities.


Reduces risk during poor harvest seasons due to income from solar energy.


 8. Innovation and Research Opportunities

Ideal model for pilot projects, research, and government-supported green schemes.

Promotes innovation in AI irrigation, remote sensing, and agro-technical optimization.


","Functionality of Agrivoltaics with Rainwater Reservoir

This system combines solar energy generation, agriculture, and rainwater harvesting into a single, synergistic setup. Each component plays a role in improving overall farm productivity, resilience, and sustainability.
 1. Solar Power Generation

Solar panels are installed above crops.

Converts sunlight into electricity to power irrigation systems, farm machinery, or be sold to the grid.

Panels also act as shelters for crops, reducing direct sun exposure and evaporation.


 2. Agriculture (Crop Cultivation)

Shade-tolerant or partial-sunlight crops grow under the panels.

Lower soil temperatures and reduced evaporation improve water-use efficiency.

Panels protect crops from extreme weather (e.g. hail, excessive heat).


 3. Rainwater Harvesting

Rainwater is collected from the tilted solar panels.

Gutters and channels direct water to a central rainwater reservoir.

Stored water is used for irrigation, livestock, or aquaculture.

4. Rainwater Reservoir Functionality

Acts as a buffer against droughts or dry spells.

Can be equipped with pumps powered by solar energy for drip or sprinkler irrigation.

Helps in groundwater recharge if designed for seepage.
","Elevated or adjustable solar panels are installed over cropland.

Types used:

Bifacial panels (capture sunlight from both sides)

Semi-transparent panels (allow partial light for crops)

Tracking systems (panels rotate to follow the sun
Dual-purpose: power generation + shade creation for crops.

Panels are tilted and connected to gutters or channels.

Rainwater from panel surfaces is collected and directed into a storage reservoir.

Technologies used:

PVC piping and filters to prevent debris entry.

Smart valves or level sensors to monitor water flow and tank levels.

A simple, uninvented technology could be a ""Community Resource Connector"". This app or platform would use a hyper-local, peer-to-peer network to connect individuals with immediate, non-monetary needs (e.g., someone needs help moving a heavy box, a ride to an appointment, or a specific tool) with neighbors willing to provide that service. It would operate on a barter or points-based system, where helping others earns you points that can be redeemed for help yourself. The technology would be simple: a GPS-based system with user profiles, a request board, and a simple rating system to build trust. It's designed to be accessible and intuitive, fostering genuine, reciprocal community service without the need for complex logistics or financial transactions.
Key Features
 * Hyper-Local Matching: Connects users within a very small radius (a few blocks or a neighborhood) to make exchanges practical and timely.
 * Simple Interface: Minimalist design, large buttons, and clear icons to ensure usability for people of all ages and tech literacy levels.
 * Trust and Safety: A simple peer-review and rating system to ensure a safe environment for all participants.
 * Barter/Points System: No cash involved. Users earn ""community points"" for helping others, which they can use to request help themselves, creating a self-sustaining cycle of giving.
This concept is simple to make because it leverages existing technology (GPS, user profiles, messaging) but applies it in a novel way to promote inclusion and community service, focusing on human connection rather than profit. It's a technology that builds on the fundamental human desire to help others and be part of a supportive community.

The device is a compact, IoT-enabled refreshable Braille module designed to assist visually impaired children in learning Braille. It converts a single English letter (A-Z, case-insensitive) selected via a lightweight web UI into a physical six-dot Braille cell. The ESP32 microcontroller, running MicroPython, hosts the web interface and uses WebSocket for real-time communication. Upon receiving a letter command, it maps the input to a standard Braille pattern and actuates six hobby servomotors (via a PCA9685 PWM driver) to raise or retract pins (rotating ~50° for raised position), enabling tactile reading. The system maintains the pin configuration until the next input and was validated with 10 visually impaired users, achieving near-100% recognition accuracy. It serves as a low-cost educational tool, notification device, or prototype for multi-cell systems.

This is our Introductory video with the trailer of the holistic film:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SG9MA_PG_XoNzCvmhvGvPbAQgZPJaOln/view?usp=drive_link","FloodSense AI bridges critical gaps in flood preparedness by uniting five core pillars: advanced sensors and data (real-time rainfall gauges, water-level sensors, soil-moisture monitors, urban drainage maps, and even public tweets/photos), a compact Flood Risk Index (FRI) formula that integrates rainfall intensity, drainage capacity, impervious surfaces, soil saturation, and urbanization factors, cutting-edge AI modeling through a CNN-LSTM architecture that learns from past floods and real-time inputs to forecast water depth up to four hours ahead at 100-meter resolution, an interactive dashboard where users can input their location to instantly view color-coded flood-risk maps and concise summaries, and community storytelling through a short film (“Breach”) that dramatizes how a student team saves their neighborhood with FloodSense AI to build trust and inspire sharing. The technical process follows a clear pipeline: continuous data ingestion from sensors, satellites, radar, and social media streams; rigorous preprocessing and rule-based filtering to normalize inputs and trigger immediate alerts when thresholds are crossed; model execution where spatial and temporal flood patterns are fused to generate predictive depth grids; and finally, alert and visualization, which auto-generates intuitive dashboards, red-yellow-green flood maps, concise zone-based summaries (e.g., “Zone A: 30cm in 60 minutes—evacuate lowlands”), and cascades alerts through mobile push, SMS, and even community loudspeakers for maximum reach and impact.","FloodSense AI’s distinctive value comes from three combined elements:

Human-centric fusion: Simultaneous integration of sensor telemetry with NLP-verified citizen reports fills gaps where sensor data is sparse and builds local trust.

Operational integrity: The watchdog and encrypted data shaft preserve raw evidence and detect tampering, which is critical for contested or low-trust environments.

Adoption-first outreach: A professionally scripted short film is embedded into the go-to-market strategy to create emotional resonance and accelerate behavioral uptake among communities and policymakers. This blend of tech, trust, and storytelling differentiates FloodSense from enterprise-focused, top-down flood solutions.","How it works:

1. Add: Press the “Add” button at the top to begin.

2. Input: Enter the required data—pulled from verified, real‑world sources.

3. Save: Hit “Save” and let FloodSense AI process the information.

4. Summarize: Click any mapped location to view a clear, concise summary of the prediction.","AI & models: Hybrid CNN–LSTM/GRU for spatio-temporal forecasting, ensemble approaches for uncertainty, and unsupervised models for anomaly detection. Models are trained on historical flood events, radar rainfall grids, and sensor streams and set up for continuous online learning from event feedback.

NLP: Local-language processing and gazetteer matching to transform informal citizen text into geolocated flood observations.

Geospatial: High-resolution DEM and land-use layers enable realistic flood-fill and vulnerability scoring.

Edge & cloud design: Lightweight edge ingestion for low-cost sensors with cloud inference for ensemble predictions and dashboarding.

Hardware approach: Low-cost ultrasonic/pressure sensors and solar-powered nodes for resilient, low-maintenance field deployments.

Validation & governance: Pilot site testing, baseline evaluation metrics (prediction vs observed depth), and plans for provisional patents on sensor-AI integration and alert protocol.

Reliability: Multi-channel alert fallbacks and integrity features mitigate single-point failures and intentional interference—improving trust and practical utility in real deployments.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

- Fatiha Haider ( Quality Assurance) ","Shebar Janala (সেবার জানালা), translated as “The Window of Services,” is a digital transparency platform designed to reimagine how social safety nets reach vulnerable citizens in Bangladesh. Every year, billions of taka are allocated to allowances such as widow support, disability stipends, and old-age pensions. Yet leakages, ghost beneficiaries, and exclusion errors undermine the system. According to HIES-based studies, nearly 71% of poor and vulnerable households remain excluded, while 46.5% of beneficiaries are ineligible. This dual crisis of under-coverage and mistargeting highlights the urgent need for a trust-driven, citizen-centric system.

Our innovation combines citizen voice with institutional accountability. Citizens can log complaints, share issues, and endorse community needs through mobile apps, SMS, or USSD — ensuring accessibility for low-tech users. Verified beneficiaries receive a “Digital Transparency Passport”, linked with NID verification, which logs entitlements and disbursements on an immutable blockchain ledger. This creates a tamper-proof trail visible to citizens, officials, and donors. An integrated AI engine automatically flags anomalies — ghost IDs, duplicate claims, diversion of goods — and routes complaints to the appropriate ward, union, or upazila offices.

By merging civic participation with advanced technology, Shebar Janala empowers citizens to see, know, and act. It transforms opacity into transparency, making corruption visible and accountability unavoidable. As a prototype developed and tested through civic-tech competitions like the UNDP Civic Tech Challenge, the system is already aligned with national ambitions for Smart Bangladesh 2041. Its modular design ensures scalability across 4,571 Union Parishads and 40M+ beneficiaries, while also adapting to disaster relief, subsidies, and climate resilience schemes.

Ultimately, Shebar Janala closes the gap between citizens and state, building trust through transparent processes and equitable service delivery.","The uniqueness of Shebar Janala lies in its fusion of grassroots citizen empowerment with cutting-edge digital tools. While Bangladesh has pioneered G2P digital payments, most existing systems are transactional rather than participatory. They digitize money flow but leave citizens without voice or visibility. Our approach bridges this gap by integrating bottom-up problem reporting with top-down transparency dashboards.

1. Citizen Voice at Scale – Unlike most safety-net systems that operate unilaterally, Shebar Janala allows citizens to report problems, attach geotagged photos, and endorse neighbors’ issues. This participatory design turns citizens into real-time auditors.


2. Blockchain Transparency – While blockchain has been piloted in financial inclusion, its application in social protection ledgering is new. Every allowance payment, relief package, or rice disbursement is logged immutably, preventing tampering by local intermediaries.


3. AI Routing & Fraud Detection – The platform uses AI for natural language processing (Bangla) and anomaly detection. Complaints are automatically tagged (e.g., infrastructure vs. welfare distribution), reducing administrative bottlenecks. Fraud signals such as duplicate NIDs or unusual distributions are flagged proactively.


4. Inclusion via USSD/SMS – Recognizing the 41% urban vs. 26% rural smartphone penetration, Shebar Janala ensures access through low-tech channels. This inclusivity is a differentiator that makes it viable for both urban poor and rural communities.


5. Multi-stakeholder Dashboards – Separate dashboards for Union Parishads, Upazila officials, and donors ensure layered accountability. Local leaders see KPIs, donors track fund utilization, and citizens verify entitlements.



In short, Shebar Janala is not just a digital payment tracker — it is a holistic ecosystem where transparency, citizen engagement, and institutional oversight converge.","Shebar Janala’s features are designed to be simple for citizens yet powerful for administrators:

Citizen Portal (Amar Sheba) – Citizens report problems using text, voice, or photos. Issues are geo-tagged and verified through NID. Neighbors can “endorse” issues, creating community prioritization.

Beneficiary Passport (Protiva) – Every eligible citizen receives a digital ID that tracks entitlements and payments. Accessible via app, SMS, or USSD, this passport ensures transparency at the individual level.

Leader Dashboard – Union/Upazila officials track disbursement rates, unresolved complaints, and fraud alerts. Tools allow merging duplicate complaints and generating ward-wise heatmaps.

Donor Dashboard – NGOs and multilateral agencies track impact, monitor anomalies, and verify that funds reach intended recipients.

AI Engine – Automates classification of complaints (e.g., social security, relief, infrastructure), filters spam/abuse, and flags fraud.

Blockchain Ledger – Anchors every transaction, creating a shared source of truth across government and citizens.

USSD/SMS Access – Ensures that even without smartphones, citizens can check eligibility or log complaints.


Together, these modules deliver a full transparency cycle: reporting → verification → logging → oversight → resolution.","At its core, Shebar Janala is a civic-tech innovation powered by AI, blockchain, and mobile accessibility.

Artificial Intelligence:

Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Bangla enables citizens to report issues in plain text or voice.

Computer Vision validates photo evidence (e.g., diverted rice sacks).

Anomaly Detection identifies ghost beneficiaries, duplicate payments, or suspicious clusters.

AI Telephony enables interactive voice response (IVR) in Bangla, ensuring accessibility for low-literacy users.


Blockchain:

A permissioned blockchain (Hyperledger/Ethereum hybrid) ensures tamper-proof disbursement logs.

Every allowance or relief payment is immutably recorded, visible to both government and citizens.

Enhances trust by preventing retroactive manipulation.


Geospatial Tech:

H3 geospatial indexing + PostGIS enables ward-wise dashboards and anomaly mapping.

Ensures precise targeting during disasters or localized fraud events.


Accessibility Features:

USSD/SMS fallback ensures participation from feature-phone users.

Bangla-first UI/UX lowers barriers for elderly and rural citizens.

Will prosper further.

How was the reality of success? Thoughts:

Bangladesh is an agricultural country. In order to achieve a sustainable economy through agriculture-based industries, the means of mechanizing farms, developing modern agricultural technology, and motivating farmers in mechanical farming, the name of a young man who is always busy inventing and producing agricultural machinery is Abul Mia. He is the son of the late Md. Matsir Ali of Char Muhammadpur village of Silam union of South Surma upazila. After completing his education, he started working as a mechanic in an engineering workshop in the city in 1987. From there, he got the addiction to discovery, and as a successful, self-reliant young man, he devoted himself to discovery. Even though he went abroad during his career, he did not give up the addiction to discovery. He used to go to the mechanical workshop in between the scheduled work in his home. He used to devote himself to mechanical work. He used to accumulate various activities of foreign mechanical workshops. In order to utilize his experience and foreign technical education, he set up an institution named Messrs. Abul Engineering Works in 1999 on Bangbir Road, South Surma, and in 2004 he set up another institution named Messrs. Abul Industries in Char Mohammadpur, Po Biraimpur, Upazila-South Surma, District-Sylhet. From those two institutions, he is engaged in researching and manufacturing alternative modern agricultural machinery to import using domestic raw materials for farm mechanization using domestic technology. He appointed several dedicated young men in his institution. Md. Abul Mia worked single-mindedly. So far, he has processed agricultural products suitable for mechanical cultivation in agriculture. He has been able to invent and produce various machinery and equipment in the field, and the agricultural machinery he invented and produced has been marketed locally and has won praise. The machinery he invented and produced for agricultural work and the processing industry are the Abul Power Tiller, Abul Paddy Threshing Mill, Abul Food Processing Mixer Machine, Abul Blinder Machine, Abul Sugar Threshing Mill, and Abul Spice Processing Machine. This machinery has been exhibited at various times in the District Agricultural Machinery Fair, and Md. Abul Mia has been successful in motivating the farmers’ processing industry institutions. The institution has been visited by many high-ranking government and private officials at various times. They have given special praise to the agricultural machinery he invented, and reports of his innovative machinery have been published in national daily newspapers.

Utilizing his innovative power during his lifetime, Md. Abul Mia started his journey in 1999 with a capital of just 300 taka. He has been working successfully by inventing the latest technology in mechanized farming, researching the country’s environment and people-friendly machinery and processing machinery for the production of agricultural products, and creating employment for several people in his institution and establishing agro-based industries. He is making a special contribution to poverty alleviation and socio-economic development. Now, only if he gets government support will he be able to invent more new technologies and bring about an agricultural revolution.

","RoboRPS is a hands-on teaching robot for computer vision, embedded ML, and robotics. A camera reads your hand while on-device models classify gestures; a servo “hand” responds in real time. Rock-Paper-Scissors is just one mode; students can also mirror their hand live or type text that the robot spells as poses. A 7″ touch display shows latency, FPS, confidence, and errors, so learners see the full loop: capture then preprocess then infer then actuate then evaluate. Everything runs offline (via USB-C power), is classroom-safe, and is plug-and-play. For learning, a one-tap Dataset Capture mode records frames with labels to CSV and images for homework and retraining, and a built-in Model Zoo ships accurate, fast, quantized, and low-light variants for trade-off comparisons. It is both a fun demo and a reusable lab platform for HRI, TinyML, and control.","Most kits stop at code or screens.

","Project Poribesh Bondhu is a comprehensive, multi-phase environmental restoration system engineered to reclaim the ecological vitality of Dhaka's urban waterways, which, as of September 2025, are critically stressed from post-monsoon runoff and years of accumulated pollutants. We address the systemic collapse of these aquatic ecosystems—suffering from chronic hypoxia, industrial and sewage-based chemical imbalances, and overwhelming solid waste—through an integrated fleet of intelligent, autonomous, solar-assisted marine drones. These units are far more than autonomous janitors; they are robotic field ecologists that perform a continuous cycle of diagnosis, treatment, and maintenance. Methodically patrolling designated zones, each drone executes three synergistic functions: it restores breath to suffocating ""dead zones"" by infusing the water column with dissolved oxygen using advanced nanobubble technology; it detoxifies the environment by filtering invisible killers like microplastics and chemical pollutants through a high-efficiency, chemical-free system; and it cleans the visible surface by collecting, compressing, and depositing floating debris for efficient shoreside disposal in direct coordination with municipal partners. This entire operation is orchestrated by a powerful AI that not only monitors the water's vital signs in real-time but also learns the unique rhythm of each waterway, allowing it to predict and preemptively address potential issues. All this invaluable data is synthesized on our public-facing Eco-Wellness Dashboard, transforming complex environmental metrics into a simple, understandable ""health score"" that empowers citizens and informs policy. Our mission is to actively transition our city's waterways from stagnant liabilities into vibrant, self-sustaining ecosystems that enhance public health, biodiversity, and civic pride.","Our solution's uniqueness is rooted in a guiding philosophy of Active Ecological Restoration, a profound shift from simple intervention to empowering nature's own healing processes. We fundamentally operate as an aquatic doctor, not a janitor; our success is therefore not measured in tons of garbage collected, but in the sustained, measurable improvement of the water’s core vital signs, such as achieving stable Dissolved Oxygen (DO) levels above 5 mg/L, balancing pH, and increasing Secchi depth (clarity). This philosophy translates directly into a strategy of targeted healing over general cleaning. For instance, our AI prioritizes resource allocation with ecological intelligence, choosing to expend its energy healing a nascent algal bloom by oxygenating the water column rather than simply collecting a patch of harmless organic debris. Furthermore, our system is distinguished by its inherently modular and scalable design. The drone is a versatile platform with interchangeable sensing, collection, and treatment modules, which future-proofs the system for new technologies and makes field maintenance incredibly efficient and cost-effective. Finally, our commitment to sustainability is absolute and holistic. The drones' hybrid solar-assisted power system is supplemented by shore-based fast charging, minimizing their carbon footprint. They are constructed from corrosion-resistant, recycled composite materials—addressing the city's plastic waste problem in their very fabrication—and utilize silent, energy-efficient thrusters to ensure they are a peaceful, regenerative presence, not an industrial disturbance, in the very environment they are built to save.","Poribesh Bondhu is equipped with a sophisticated suite of features, each designed for gentle, effective, and intelligent environmental care. The brain of the operation is the Eco-Vision AI, a computer vision system that goes beyond simple object detection to observe and understand the ecosystem's state, identifying subtle signs of distress like the discoloration from harmful algal blooms alongside floating garbage. At its heart is the Water Healing System, a dual-function module that forms the core of its restorative capabilities. The Vitality Infusion component uses an efficient venturi aeration system to gently bubble dissolved oxygen into the water, replenishing this critical element for fish and beneficial microorganisms. Simultaneously, the Gentle Filtration Module employs a passive, multi-stage filter—mimicking a riverbank's natural process with layers of mesh and activated carbon—to remove harmful micro-pollutants without using any chemicals. For larger debris, a Gentle Debris Collection system uses a retractable net to gather surface garbage like plastic bottles and bags. The drone’s Harmony Navigation System then guides it to designated shoreline points to offload this waste for proper disposal. All the real-time data collected by its sensors is transmitted to the cloud and displayed on the public-facing Eco-Wellness Dashboard, which uses intuitive graphs and heatmaps to communicate the waterway's health to the community. This entire process is guided by the Harmony Navigation System, an advanced autonomous algorithm that plots the quietest and most energy-efficient paths, ensuring the drone is always a peaceful and effective presence in the water.","We apply a carefully integrated stack of modern technology with a deep and abiding respect for the natural world, ensuring our solution is both powerfully effective and fundamentally environmentally responsible. The drone's intelligence is driven by adaptive AI and machine learning; we use advanced convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the Eco-Vision system and employ reinforcement learning for the Harmony Navigation System, allowing the drone to learn the unique rhythms of its environment and improve its care strategies over time. The platform is a showcase of sustainable and green technology. It relies entirely on high-efficiency solar panels coupled with an intelligent battery management system to ensure 24/7 operation with zero carbon footprint. Its energy-conserving motors and hydrodynamic design are testaments to our commitment to green engineering principles. Each drone functions as a mobile node in a sophisticated environmental Internet of Things (IoT) sensing network. It uses an array of low-power, scientific-grade sensors to continuously ""feel"" the pulse of the water, gathering high-fidelity data that is transmitted via a LoRaWAN gateway to a secure, time-series cloud database. This rich dataset becomes an invaluable resource for data science and conservation. By providing this longitudinal data to the scientific community, we allow researchers to analyze long-term trends, model complex ecosystem dynamics, correlate pollution events with external factors, and gain the deep insights needed to create effective, evidence-based conservation policies for the future.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

Abdullah Al Junaed - General Member
Al Imran - General Member 
Mahdi Al Wakil - General Member","Shongothon is a financial coordination app designed for groups in Bangladesh, such as families, student batches, office colleagues, and community samiti groups. The solution is not meant to replace money transfer services like bKash and Nagad, but to provide a necessary layer of transparency, accountability, and trust for managing collective funds. The app allows groups to create shared financial pots, track all contributions, and make collaborative decisions about how the money is spent. It works by digitizing the informal systems that people already use, like welfare funds and bill-splitting, thereby removing the friction and mistrust associated with paper ledgers and word-of-mouth accounting. This approach directly addresses the cultural nuances of community financing in Bangladesh, where collective saving and spending are deeply ingrained social habits. For instance, office colleagues frequently pool money for daily lunches or social events, families manage shared household budgets, and student groups split costs for projects and trips. Currently, these activities are managed through cumbersome and unreliable methods like WhatsApp groups cluttered with screenshots of transactions, or paper notebooks that can be easily lost or altered. Shongothon provides a centralized, digital ledger that is accessible to all members, ensuring that every transaction is recorded and visible. By formalizing these informal financial activities, the app not only enhances efficiency and reduces the potential for disputes but also builds a foundation of trust. It transforms ambiguous, memory-based accounting into a concrete, auditable record, allowing social and familial relationships to thrive without the underlying strain of financial uncertainty. Ultimately, Shongothon aims to be the indispensable organizational tool that empowers communities to manage their collective wealth with confidence and clarity, strengthening the very fabric of these social networks.","The uniqueness of Shongothon lies in its focus on solving the coordination and trust issues in group finance, a gap not addressed by existing money transfer apps like bKash and Nagad. It tackles the primary reasons informal groups collapse, such as lack of transparency, suspicion of treasurers, and poor record-keeping. Its distinctive features directly create trust and accountability. The app's Auto-Tracking from Transaction SMS automatically parses bKash/Nagad transaction SMS to update the ledger, a unique feature that reduces manual effort and errors. This is fundamentally different from simply sending money; it’s about creating an intelligent, self-updating record book that requires minimal user intervention, thereby lowering the barrier to accurate bookkeeping. The Trust Meter™ provides a reliability score for each member based on their payment history, offering a novel way to quantify dependability within a group. This gamified approach to financial responsibility is a powerful social motivator, creating a transparent reputation system that encourages timely contributions more effectively than social pressure alone. Additionally, holding funds in an Escrow for Groups wallet until specific conditions are met directly solves the core trust issue with a single treasurer. This feature acts as a neutral third party, safeguarding funds for a specific purpose—like a group trip or a large purchase—and only releasing them when the agreed-upon conditions, such as full funding, are met. This single feature can eliminate the most common point of failure in informal group finance. Finally, unlike informal discussions on WhatsApp, the Poll & Vote on Spending feature creates a transparent and logged decision-making process, ensuring accountability. It provides a structured forum for debate and resolution, ensuring that every member has a voice and that the final decision is a matter of public record within the group, preventing future arguments about how or why a decision was made.","The app's core functionality is delivered through a set of specific features designed for seamless and transparent group financial management. The user journey begins with Auto-Tracking from Transaction SMS, where members can simply forward their bKash/Nagad transaction confirmation SMS to a designated number, or use a share function within the app. The system then intelligently parses the message, extracts key information like sender, amount, and transaction ID, and automatically updates the group ledger in real-time. This eliminates the tedious and error-prone process of manual data entry. Central to the app's trust-building mechanism is the Trust Meter™, a dynamic score assigned to each member. This score is prominently displayed on user profiles and is calculated using an algorithm that considers the timeliness of contributions, participation in polls, and overall consistency. This feature provides an at-a-glance measure of reliability for all members. To facilitate collaborative and democratic decision-making, the Poll & Vote on Spending feature allows any member to propose an expense and create a poll. Other members receive a notification and can cast their vote within a set timeframe. The results are displayed transparently with a clear breakdown, and the final decision is automatically recorded in the group’s history, creating an immutable audit trail. For high-value goals and to mitigate risk, the Escrow for Groups functionality allows a group to set up a dedicated pot where contributions are held securely. Funds are locked and cannot be withdrawn by any single member; they are only released automatically once predefined rules, such as reaching a funding target by a certain date, are met. Lastly, the Emergency Help Button serves as a community safety net. When a member faces a crisis, they can activate this feature, which instantly sends a push notification to all group members with a clear call for help and a direct link to contribute, streamlining the process of mobilizing urgent support.","Shongothon applies modern technology to digitize and secure these informal financial interactions, focusing on reliability, security, and user experience. The backbone of its automation is a sophisticated SMS Parsing Technology. This involves developing and maintaining a robust engine, likely using advanced regular expressions and potentially lightweight machine learning models, to accurately read and interpret the varied and evolving SMS templates from different mobile financial services like bKash and Nagad. This ensures high accuracy in data entry, which is critical for user trust. The ""Trust Meter™"" is powered by an algorithm-driven trust score, which is a practical application of data science. This algorithm will analyze behavioral data—such as payment punctuality against deadlines, frequency of participation in votes, and consistency in contributions—to generate a fair and dynamic reliability metric. This requires a carefully designed data model to weigh different positive and negative actions appropriately. A cornerstone of the app's security model is the secure digital escrow service. This is a complex financial technology integration that requires partnering with a licensed financial institution to hold funds. The entire process will be secured with bank-grade encryption, two-factor authentication, and will need to adhere strictly to the regulatory frameworks for financial services in Bangladesh, ensuring that users' funds are always safe. To keep users engaged and informed, the app also leverages real-time push notifications. This system is built on a reliable backend infrastructure, ensuring that critical alerts for voting deadlines, payment reminders, and especially the Emergency Help Button, are delivered instantly and reliably across different devices and network conditions. Finally, the long-term vision includes using ethical data analytics. This involves implementing strong data anonymization and aggregation techniques to study community-level financial behaviors without compromising user privacy. The resulting insights could be invaluable for NGOs, researchers, and policymakers, all while adhering to a strict, opt-in-based data governance framework.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

This multi-modal system integrates smoke sensors, computer vision, and temperature monitoring to ensure accurate and timely responses. The process initiates with an MQ2 smoke sensor that continuously monitors for potential fire incidents. Upon detecting smoke, a custom-trained YOLOv11n computer vision model is activated to visually confirm the presence of fire using existing CCTV infrastructure. If the visual confirmation is positive, an alarm is triggered immediately. However, if the model does not detect a fire, a third layer of validation is initiated, where an LM35 temperature sensor checks for a significant rise in ambient temperature. This layered approach ensures a comprehensive and reliable fire detection system that balances accuracy, speed, and resource efficiency, making it a practical solution for residential, commercial, and industrial settings.","The uniqueness of our solution lies in its hierarchical, multi-sensor validation approach, which addresses the critical flaws of conventional fire detection systems. Unlike standalone smoke detectors prone to false alarms from non-fire sources like dust or steam, or computationally expensive continuous video analysis systems, our framework activates its more resource-intensive components only when necessary. The ""always-on, first-alert"" smoke sensor acts as a low-power trigger for the AI-powered visual verification. This sequential activation of sensors, from smoke to computer vision and finally to temperature, creates a fail-safe mechanism that drastically minimizes false positives. Furthermore, the system is designed to be hardware-agnostic and can be integrated with existing CCTV networks, making it a cost-effective and scalable solution that can be adapted to various indoor environments without requiring expensive infrastructure overhauls. The use of a lightweight YOLOv11n model ensures that the system can run on standard surveillance hardware, eliminating the need for high-end computational resources.","Our fire detection system is built on a three-layer validation process to ensure high accuracy and reliability. Key functionalities and features include:
Primary Smoke Detection: An MQ-2 gas sensor continuously monitors the environment for smoke particles, serving as the primary trigger for the system. This component is highly energy-efficient as it is the only part of the system that is always active.
AI-Powered Visual Verification: Upon smoke detection, a custom-trained YOLOv11n AI model analyzes the live feed from a connected camera to visually confirm the presence of flames. This model can accurately detect various types of fires, including those from cooking oil, electrical sources, gas, liquids, metals, and solids.
Temperature Cross-Validation: If the AI model does not detect a fire despite the presence of smoke, an LM35 temperature sensor is activated as a fail-safe. A sharp increase in temperature will trigger an alarm, ensuring that fires are detected even if they are visually obstructed.
False Alarm Mitigation: The multi-layer validation process ensures that alarms are only triggered when there is corroborating evidence from at least two different sources, significantly reducing false positives from common environmental factors.
Seamless Integration: The system is designed to integrate with existing CCTV surveillance networks, making it a cost-effective and easily deployable solution.","The technological foundation of our project is a robust integration of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and advanced Artificial Intelligence. The custom-trained YOLOv11n model demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving a high precision of 97.9% and a recall of 97.1%. This high level of accuracy is critical for a life-saving application such as fire detection. The model has been trained on a diverse dataset of 9,128 images, enabling it to accurately identify six different classes of fire. The system's modular architecture, controlled by an ESP32 microcontroller, allows for wireless communication and easy scalability.
This technology is highly applicable in a wide range of indoor environments. In residential buildings, it can provide early and reliable warnings, protecting lives and property. In commercial spaces like offices and warehouses, it can prevent catastrophic financial losses and ensure business continuity. For industrial settings, where the risk of fire can be higher, this system offers a more reliable and cost-effective safety solution than traditional systems. By leveraging existing infrastructure and low-cost, efficient components, our system provides a high-quality, accessible, and adaptable solution for enhancing fire safety in smart buildings and industrial applications.",Yes,Yes,Yes,No

","Threadsense is an AI-powered quality control system designed for garment factories. It combines cameras, sensors, and intelligent software to automatically inspect cut fabric panels and verify that they meet specifications.
How the solution works:
Capture: Cameras scan each panel, a GSM station measures fabric weight, a colorimeter detects shade variations, and barcodes track order details.
Analyze: AI models process these inputs to detect visual defects such as holes, stains, and yarn breaks, as well as more subtle issues like shade mismatches or potential shrinkage.
Decide: Based on combined results, operators receive clear instructions on whether to accept, hold, or rework a panel, supported with photographic evidence.
Trace: Every check is recorded in a digital log for factory records and buyer audits, making quality management more transparent.
This approach ensures that problems are caught early, production delays are reduced, and overall efficiency is improved without disrupting existing workflows.","Threadsense is not a generic industrial tool but one designed specifically for the textile industry. Its uniqueness lies in:

","The Automated Medication Management and Assistive Unit (AMMAU) is a modular smart dispenser designed to help elderly patients manage complex medication schedules. It features guided setup through a touchscreen and provides both on-screen and voice prompts for scheduled doses. Using IR sensors, it detects when a hand approaches a slot, announces the medication and dosage, and, after a simple Yes/No confirmation, logs intake and updates inventory. Caregivers receive real-time alerts for low stock. For insulin users, an embedded ML module predicts basal doses based on fasting glucose and body weight, offering a cross-check against the physician’s plan to flag unusual deviations. This ensures timely dosing, reduces errors, maintains accurate records, and eases the burden on families and caregivers.","Most solutions separate tasks: pill dispensers manage medications while apps handle insulin calculations. AMMAU brings both together, integrating multi-medication dispensing with AI-driven basal insulin guidance in a single device and interface. Each insulin dose is paired with simple health inputs, such as fasting glucose and weight, providing safer, context-aware prompts now and valuable trend tracking over time. Designed for real homes and low-resource settings, it combines a touch interface, IR sensing, voice alerts, caregiver notifications, and offline-first functionality, ensuring reliable dosing even without internet access. A key differentiator is its power resilience: a 9V DC primary supply with automatic failover to a 10,000 mAh internal battery and a low-power mode that extends runtime during outages. The insulin prediction model, trained on a 9,672-record clinically validated dataset, achieves an R² of ~0.96 and runs fully on-device for fast, private recommendations. One unit. One seamless workflow.","●	Modular capacity: The unit can be built with 4 to 20 slots in a compact 46 × 37 × 6.5 cm box that is small enough for a bedside table, big enough for a full regimen.
●	Simple setup on touch screen: Use Set Box to name each slot and enter the starting quantity. Use Set Schedule to add medicine names, doses, and times. The system groups meds taken at the same time, so nothing is missed.
●	Reminders: At the right time, the screen shows exactly what to take, and the speaker reads it out. If a dose is missed, caregivers get a notification. The device asks, “Taken?”. A quick Yes/No confirms the dose.
●	Automatic adherence log: Every confirmed and missed dose is time-stamped and saved. You can export reports for a doctor visit or share with family.
●	Live inventory tracking: The system counts pills as you go and sends early low-stock alerts so you can refill before you run out.
●	AI help for insulin (basal): Enter fasting glucose (mg/dL or mmol/L) and body weight (kg). The on-device model suggests a basal insulin dose (units) and flags unusual differences from your usual plan so you can double-check with your doctor.
●	Made for elders: Large text, high contrast, and Bangla/English on both screen and voice prompts keep it accessible.
●	Clear roles and records: Separate patient and caregiver profiles, complete with timestamps and an audit trail for accountability.
●	Built-in safety: Optional lockout windows can prevent accidental extra doses. Each slot has tamper detection.
●	Connected, but works offline: You get email/app alerts when connected. If the internet goes down, core dosing still works.
●	Power: Normally runs on 9 V DC. During a power cut, it automatically switches to the 10,000 mAh internal battery and enters low-power mode (dimmed screen, batched alerts) to stretch runtime.
","●	Hardware: Runs a Linux system on Raspberry Pi 4, with a 7” touchscreen, IR sensors on every slot, and a speaker for clear prompts, inside a compact, wipe-clean tabletop enclosure.
●	Software: The Django app handles the UI, schedules, logs, and inventory. A separate Flask service runs the ML model. Data lives in a local database, and caregiver notifications are sent securely.
●	AI module: Basal-insulin prediction was tested with KNN, MLR, and LightGBM. Models were trained on a 9,672-record, medically benchmarked synthetic dataset. The top model achieved R² ≥ 0.96 with low MAE and runs on-device with guardrails and human-in-the-loop checks.
●	Reliability engineering: Debounced sensor reads prevent false triggers. Structured med/dose records, startup self-tests, and a watchdog with safe defaults help the system recover from glitches. If the network is down, the notifications queue is sent later.
●	Data & safety: Time-stamped adherence logs, configurable thresholds, and exportable reports support clinician review.
●	Power architecture: Power-path management switches to the 10,000 mAh internal battery in <10 ms. The 9 V input is protected (reverse/over-voltage) and smart-charged.
●	Battery optimization: On battery, a low-power governor, adaptive backlight, sensor duty-cycling, and batched/quieter audio extend runtime. Coulomb counting reports state of charge/health with on-screen runtime estimates.

Our team consists of multidisciplinary background team members from EEE and Urban Planning with domain expertise in traffic engineering and urban planning, with strong technical capacity in AI, machine learning, and real-time traffic data analysis. Supported by simulation management expertise and user-friendly design skills, we bridge policy, technology, and city dynamics to create a practical, scalable solution tailored for urban challenges.","Our Park2Go is an AI-driven smart parking platform built to simplify urban journeys. It helps to find the safest, nearest legal parking spot based on the destination. Park2Go app will integrate between drivers and unused parking spaces. It will have real-time slot matching, with traffic congestion, weather, location, and hourly-based dynamic pricing. Digital map integration with the geological information system and real-time traffic prediction will regulate and minimize traffic congestion. With AI-powered parking assistant, users will have the best decision-making advice. The variations and comparisons between different parking spaces will help to make perfect preferences. With real-time slot matching, user-friendly AI assistance, and vehicle security, Park2Go makes parking faster, safer, and smarter—right when and where it is needed.","Park2Go is different because it shows real-time availability using CCTV feeds processed on the device (edge AI), not guesses or user check-ins. 

It also uses a dynamic pricing model led by live traffic flow rate and surrounding land use characteristics: prices go higher in crowded areas or peak times to move some drivers to nearby streets or later times, and lower in underused areas to pull drivers away from congested zones. Short stays near busy spots are encouraged to keep fast turnover, and prices can adjust before big events to spread demand. 

This guides where and when people choose to park, which reduces circling, cuts illegal parking, and eases congestion.The platform connects drivers and space owners so unused private or commercial spots can be rented easily—an end-to-end approach that makes parking faster, safer, and smarter for the city.","Features:

* Real-time nearby slot matching
* CCTV based vacancy detection
* Congestion led multi factor dynamic pricing model
* Comparison of slots by cost, distance, security
* AI assistant guidance
* Space-owner rental platform
* Automatic pricing, booking, payments


Park2Go delivers end-to-end smart parking for drivers and space owners. The app instantly shows nearby legal and safe parking spots, matched in real time with the user’s destination, traffic congestion, and weather conditions. A multi-factor dynamic pricing model (traffic congestion,demand, duration, time of day, events, history) automatically sets fair rates—while comparisons across available slots help users choose by cost, distance, and security.

Edge-based computer vision from CCTV feeds confirms whether a slot is occupied, keeping availability data accurate. An AI assistant offers quick, context-aware guidance to help drivers avoid stress and wasted time. Digital maps with live traffic rerouting guide drivers smoothly to their selected spot.

For space owners, Park2Go provides a digital platform to list and rent unused parking. The platform handles pricing automatically, manages bookings and secure payments, and provides transparent reporting. The result is faster, safer parking with reduced road congestion and improved urban mobility.
","Map Integration & Routing
The system uses OpenStreetMap for base maps and Nominatim for geocoding. Live
congestion is tracked through Mapbox Traffic API (with alternative providers configurable).
Routing and travel time estimation are powered by OpenRouteService, while spatial
queries run on PostgreSQL with PostGIS for proximity search and zone-based processing.
Dynamic Pricing Engine
At the core is a high-performance service built on Python FastAPI with
PostgreSQL/PostGIS. It ingests live traffic, parking supply–demand ratios, and time-of-day
patterns to compute dynamic prices. Redis accelerates frequent lookups, while Celery
manages scheduled recalculations. For demand forecasting, LightGBM is used, with
scalability toward PyTorch as historical data grows.
Mobile Application
Drivers interact through a Flutter app deployed to Android and iOS. Maps are rendered with
Mapbox SDK, and real-time updates arrive via WebSockets, showing instantly which slots
are free and what they cost.
AI-Powered Assistant
An in-app assistant built on Rasa (self-hosted) helps with bookings, FAQs, and support.
Hugging Face transformer models enable sentiment detection in Bengali and English,
allowing the chatbot to respond empathetically and guide users smoothly.
Computer Vision for Vacancy Detection
Where CCTV infrastructure is available, video streams are processed on edge devices
running YOLOv8 through OpenCV + ONNX Runtime. Deployed on NVIDIA Jetson, these
detect occupancy locally and feed results directly into the availability API—providing
accurate, automated updates without burdening networks.
Payments & Security
The app integrates with bKash and Nagad via SSLCOMMERZ, alongside support for
international cards. Authentication uses Firebase Auth with phone/OAuth logins. Security
features include JWT authorization, TLS encryption, and AES-256 for sensitive data
storage.
Cloud Infrastructure & Monitoring
Services are containerized with Docker and deployed on Google Cloud Run for
auto-scaling. Databases run on Cloud SQL (Postgres), while static assets are stored in
Google Cloud Storage with CDN distribution. Monitoring and analytics rely on Firebase

When pests spread, soil becomes weak, or sudden weather changes occur, they have no reliable way of knowing what action to take. A single wrong decision can destroy their entire harvest, leaving families in debt and communities struggling with food shortages.
AgriSense was born to solve this problem. It is a low-cost system that uses small sensors placed in the farmland to track soil moisture, pH, temperature, crop health and other data. This information is sent to a server without internet, where AI analyzes the data and generates simple, practical advice. It suggests both natural remedies and professional solutions considering all the factors for the farmland and crops.  Farmers then receive SMS messages or automated phone calls in their local language telling them what to do—whether it’s to irrigate, add nutrients, or prepare for heavy rain. It also has web-app support for a more detailed dashboard and features in case someone needs to use it. 
But AgriSense goes further. Farmers without smartphones can call a number and speak directly with an AI assistant in their local language, asking about crop problems and receiving instant solutions. The system also integrates weather forecasts and market prices, so farmers not only protect their crops but also know the best time to sell them.
Beyond individual support, AgriSense enables farmer-to-farmer knowledge sharing. A farmer can record their problem by voice, which the system translates and shares with experts or other farmers who have faced similar issues. Meanwhile, policymakers and NGOs can monitor the dashboard, gaining real-time insights into pest outbreaks, drought-prone zones, or communities needing urgent help. Also they get realtime market price update to be protected from low price. Also they can sell their project. All available by calling.
With AgriSense, farmers no longer have to farm in the dark. They get timely guidance, their yields increase, losses decrease, and rural communities grow stronger. By bridging modern technology with local culture, this project gives every farmer—whether literate or not—the power to farm smarter, feed more people, and secure a better future.
","AgriSense is unique because it makes modern agricultural intelligence accessible without requiring internet, literacy, or smartphones. Unlike most smart farming systems that target large commercial farms, AgriSense is designed for rural smallholder farmers with minimal resources.

AgriTerra Finance
Team Lead: Md Emon Chowdhury
Fatema Akter Munni","AgriTerra Finance is a transformative FinTech platform designed to address the significant challenges of land ownership disputes and lack of credit access faced by smallholder farmers in Bangladesh.
The platform's core solution involves tokenizing verified land titles using blockchain technology, which allows farmers to use fractional land assets as secure, liquid collateral for low-cost agricultural loans.
Problem and Market Opportunity
The platform addresses the foundational issue that the chaotic state of land ownership and real estate records in Bangladesh locks over 20 million smallholder farmers out of formal credit. Evidence shows that 80% of all court cases in Bangladesh relate to land disputes. This forces farmers to seek funding from informal money lenders, resulting in debilitating interest rates, often between 20–30%.
AgriTerra Finance targets the $10 Billion Bangladesh agri financing market (Total Addressable Market) and is built for scalability across the APAC FinTech ecosystem, which faces similar land record challenges.
Technological Architecture and Key Features
AgriTerra Finance utilizes a cloud-based stack that merges security with real-time data verification:
Tokenization Engine (Blockchain): The platform uses Hyperledger Fabric for its permissioned blockchain network, which is chosen for compliance and scalability. This engine manages the fractionalization of land, where, for example, 1 acre of verified land may equate to 100 digital tokens used as collateral.
AI for Credit Scoring: Artificial Intelligence is central to risk assessment. The platform uses a Python backend and the sklearn.linear_model library, specifically the Logistic Regression algorithm, to predict the probability of default risk. Key inputs for the model include land value (verified_value), land size (land_acres), and historical crop yield (crop_yield).
Integrated Verification: Verification is achieved by blending digitized government records with Satellite APIs (e.g., Google Earth Engine) for real-time land assessment and boundary verification. This cross-verification aims to achieve 95% accuracy in land valuation and is expected to cut documentation fraud by up to 50% compared to existing manual processes used by incumbents.
Partner Dashboard: Lending partners (MFIs/Banks) access the verified collateral and credit scores via a Partner API & Analytics Dashboard, often visualized using tools like Power BI.
Business Model and Traction
AgriTerra operates on a B2B2C business model. The Users are the smallholder farmers who obtain instant, low-cost loans using their tokenized land as collateral. The Buyers are Microfinance Institutions (MFIs), Banks, and Cooperatives (such as BRAC) who pay for the secure, verified collateral stream, which lowers their default risk.
Revenue Streams: The primary revenue comes from a 2% transaction fee charged on the loan volume processed through the platform.
Traction: Initial pilot testing, conducted through cooperatives, successfully processed loans for 500 users, totaling $50K in loans. The platform maintains a target default rate of 10% or less.
Financial Goals: The company is currently seeking $500K in seed funding. This investment will be used to scale the MVP to 50,000 users within 12 months, aiming for $2 Million in Year 1 Revenue, and targeting financial break-even by Month 18.

","Quadruped robots are one of the important platforms in the field of mobile robotics, as they offer enhanced mobility and impressive stability over the complex terrain. These capabilities make the quadruped highly suitable for military operations, industrial applications, and assistance in disaster scenarios. The focus of this research is to design and development of an 8-degree-of-freedom (8-DoF) quadruped robot with the objectives of enhancing the design architecture, optimizing the distribution of joint torques, and improved gait design. The operational framework emphasizes combining 3D modelling to ensure optimal weight distribution, torque analyses, uniform actuator control, and comprehensive gait analyses. The developed prototype is capable of adapting locomotion showing its stability in balancing. It also demonstrates stable and versatile movements across a wide range of indoor terrains. Experimental results indicate its reliability and applicability in critical environments. Applications such as search-and-rescue, would potentially benefit from this stabilized modes of motion.","The project stands out in its coupled and combined solution to some of the biggest issues of quadruped robotics in a moderate-DOF setting. Although many works deal with individual aspects, this thesis integrates several key fields that are not usually tackled together for 8-DOF systems.
Some of the key unique points are:
Integrated Design Framework: The project combines, for the first time, mechanical design optimization, advanced control methodologies, intelligent motion planning, and real-time adaptive control into a single integrated framework.
Emphasis on Moderate-DOF Systems: A majority of the state-of-the-art research is directed towards high-DOF or soft robots. This work exactly bridges the void in 8-DOF platforms, which sacrifice mechanical complexity for control tractability, by addressing synchronization between gait type and torque distribution for improved energy efficiency.
Torque-Aware Gait Control: Unlike the naive gait scheduling of other designs, this project performs a detailed torque analysis to ensure that the chosen actuators (servo motors) can manage the physical demands, preventing overload and failure. This analysis directly informs the motion planning and control strategy.
","The quadruped robot is a functional prototype with a range of features for stable locomotion and control.
Core Functionality:
Locomotion: The robot can perform stable walking and turning motions using fundamental gait patterns like crawl and trot.
Coordinated Movement: Coordinated movement is realized through independent control of all eight joints (two per leg: one hip, one knee) in a manner to facilitate smooth movement.
Dynamic Balance: An ADXL345 accelerometer provides real-time orientation data to the control system, which can sense tilt or sudden movement and provide urgency corrections to balance.
Wireless Control: Wireless communication is provided through an HC-05 module, allowing remote control and receipt of commands.
Key Features:
Control System: A centralized control system is run by an Arduino Uno microcontroller. It reads sensor data and sends commands to the motors.
Actuation: Movement is provided by nine MG995/MG996R high-torque servo motors, eight of which are utilized for the leg joints and one of which may be utilized for accessory functions like a camera.
Power Management: A PCA9685 Servo Driver precisely controls all servos, offloading the main processor and delivering a stable power supply to the motors.
Modular Physical Structure: The robot's chassis and leg pieces were developed using 3D modeling and manufactured using lightweight materials like PLA or ABS, offering a balance of strength, low inertia, and manufacturability.","The quality is ensured by a systematic and disciplined engineering process:
Simulation and Modeling: A 3D model in fine detail was created to visualize the robot structure, simulate the range of motion, and optimize the mechanical design before physical assembly.

Data-Driven Analysis: The design does not rely on arbitrary guesswork but is built on the foundation of quantitative torque analysis. Calculations were made to determine the exact torque demand of the hip (1.47 Nm) and knee (0.735 Nm) joints, substantiating the fact that the MG995/MG996R motors chosen (~1.6-1.8 Nm) would be sufficient.

Systematic Testing: The robot's walking sequences and motions were tested experimentally and documented with images and data tables, substantiating the success of the gait patterns that had been executed.


The project effectively employs affordable and accessible technology to achieve its goals:
Microcontroller and Drivers: Arduino Uno and PCA9685 servo driver are an effective and popular pair to drive multiple servos for robotics, and this allows the design to be reproducible and low-cost.
3D Printing: Physical development of the robot was created using 3D printing, which allowed for rapid prototyping and the creation of light, custom-designed parts.

Real-World Scenarios: The technology is designed for high-stakes, real-world use in applications where mobility in difficult environments is paramount. These include:

●	Search and Rescue / Disaster Response
●	Industrial Inspection and Automation
●	Defense and Military Reconnaissance
●	Environmental Monitoring

There's no one on the streets, and she feels unsafe. With just a voice command, she activates the SOS mode. Her phone instantly captures an undercover live video, alerts local authorities, and alerts nearby volunteers. She is no longer alone in seconds—technology becomes her guardian.

This is ""Nirapod"", our safety solution which is revolutionary for Bangladesh. As citizens, especially women, are in danger and corruption is further escalating, Nirapod provides a new generation of protection.

Our platform consists of a mobile app, website, and an AI-powered system that can safeguard people in everyday life. Its key features are:

AI-powered CCTV monitoring to detect suspicious or criminal behavior in real time.

Smart SOS crisis response with live hidden video and immediate alert to the authorities.

Suspicious activity detection and reporting for a safer community.

Live database that ensures trustworthy, fast, and secure data transmission for citizens and officials alike. 

Blending the newest technology with human-driven design, Nirapod empowers citizens, builds trust, and reduces corruption. We believe that this project not only makes individual security better, but also builds safer communities across Bangladesh.

Our commitment is simple but firm:
""Your Safety, Our Commitment.""","Nirapod is not just a safety app but a comprehensive, AI-driven safety ecosystem. Its uniqueness lies in bringing together a number of high-end features onto one platform and offering not just individual safety but also systemic accountability. Some of the key differentiators include:

Voice-Activated SOS with Secret Live Video Recording – Unlike other SOS apps, Nirapod allows users to trigger emergency alerts using voice commands. A secret live video is instantly recorded and uploaded, not visible on the user's phone, as tamper-proof evidence.

AI-Driven CCTV & Suspicious Activity Detection (Including Corruption Monitoring) – Not just does our system identify crimes, but it identifies patterns of corruption or suspicious behavior in real time, a first in Bangladesh.

Criminal Identification System – Using image recognition technology, authorities are able to trace and track suspects across connected CCTV networks, making law enforcement response even faster.

Dynamic Crime Map & Safe Route Planner – Nirapod, by analyzing crime data, generates a dynamic crime map and suggests safer paths of travel, as well as alerting the users if they are venturing into risky zones.

Child Safety & Parental Tools – Parents can monitor the safety of their children through location tracking, geofence notifications, and custom safety plans, addressing one of the most sensitive public problems.

Why It's Unique:
Most safety apps are emergency-only focused. Nirapod goes beyond that—it prevents crime, builds trust, reduces corruption, and empowers citizens with AI, data, and community involvement. This makes it a first-of-its-kind solution in Bangladesh.","1.SOS Emergency System – Users can trigger the SOS system with an SOS voice call or a pre-set signal. The system will automatically record a one-minute hidden live video (which is not visible on the user's device) and upload it safely into our database. At the same time, local authorities and nearby volunteers will be notified immediately.

2.AI-Based Crime Detection – Our AI system is constantly on the lookout for connected CCTV cameras, enabling automatic identification of suspicious or criminal activity in real-time.

3.Detection of Criminals – The system automatically scans through connected cameras by uploading an arrestee's photo. If the individual passes in front of any CCTV, then the concerned authorities are immediately notified.

4.Smart Home Safety – Along with home CCTV cameras, the system offers immediate photo notifications to the homeowner's cell phone whenever an individual approaches the door for advanced safety.

5.Parents & Kids Safety System – The parents can track the child's location. If the child moves outside a predetermined safe zone, the system automatically notifies the family.

6.Fake Call Feature – Users are able to create a fake incoming call in embarrassing or perilous circumstances, providing an alibi or distraction to avoid harm.

7.Anonymous Review System – Individuals are able to post reviews or comments about administrative officials without disclosing their identities to ensure safety and openness.

8.Crime Map & Safe Route Navigation – From reported offenses for mapping, a live crime map is made. It provides safer routes for travel according to crime patterns. Alerts are also provided to the users if they are nearby  high-crime areas.

","“My Personal Hajj-Umrah Guide” Mobile App

Introduction:
This is an innovative mobile app focused on religious education and information technology. It is a comprehensive and non-profit initiative. The app has been developed entirely free of charge for Hajj and Umrah pilgrims. From the initial planning of a Muslim’s Hajj or Umrah journey to returning home after completing the pilgrimage, this mobile app guide contains all kinds of essential step-by-step instructions.

It is called a “personal guide” because it acts like a personal assistant for a pilgrim. During Hajj and Umrah there are many small details to know or questions that arise, which are not always possible to ask a guide every time. In such situations, a mobile app stands by like a tireless friend or guide at all times.

Currently, there is no app of this kind on Google Play Store or Apple App Store. This is one of the most feature-rich and content-rich Hajj-Umrah guide apps. It has been developed in 12 languages with authentic content for people all over the world. At present, alongside printed guidebooks, the use of mobile app-based guides is increasing among Hajj and Umrah pilgrims, and through mobile apps it has become possible to present educational aspects of Hajj and Umrah in a modern and engaging way.

Usage Description:
When the mobile app is launched, it first asks some questions about the pilgrim’s journey plans. Based on that, the app will automatically determine customized preparations, itinerary, topics, daily tasks, and other matters for the pilgrim.

A Hajj or Umrah pilgrim needs to start preparing long before the journey. Just as material preparation is essential for this journey, spiritual preparation is equally important. This guide app provides extensive checklists and descriptions for both, so that nothing is left incomplete.

It also gives advance, practical information and topics about preparation for the journey and about various matters in Makkah and Madinah, so that one does not face difficulties searching after arriving there. In addition, the app contains information about various services in Makkah and Madinah such as hotels, transport, catering, ziyārah guides, health and other related matters.

Based on the timing of the pilgrim’s journey, a customized tour itinerary will be prepared inside the app, and it will include descriptions of different places of interest along with Google location pins, making it easy to visit all those sites.

The app contains a large Q&A repository about Hajj and Umrah, enabling pilgrims to test their knowledge through quizzes and strengthen their understanding.

Inside the app there are two separate guidebooks on Hajj and Umrah. These guides are very informative and detailed. They not only state what needs to be done during Hajj and Umrah but also mention what mistakes and wrong actions should be avoided. They provide sufficient guidance on relevant Islamic rulings (masā’il).

The app’s most innovative and attractive feature is the step-by-step chart guide for performing Hajj and Umrah. It will feel as if someone is holding your hand and guiding you through every rule and ritual, leaving no room for error.

Additionally, the app contains daily action guidance for a pilgrim from morning till night, as well as a large collection of supplications and remembrances (duʿā and dhikr) including only authentic ones.

Finally, the app includes several small features such as: location maps of Makkah, Madinah, Mina, and Arafah tents; Makkah and Madinah live TV channels; prayer times of Makkah and Madinah; Qibla direction; weather forecast; flight tracking; tasbīḥ (prayer bead) counter; Qur’an app; Islamic books app; and links to some other useful apps.

In Conclusion:
Everything a Hajj or Umrah pilgrim may need can be found completely inside this single app, right in the palm of their hand, and it will feel like having a personal assistant or guide with them at all times.","Key Uniqueness & Differentiators

","Force Sensitive Smart Toothbrush is designed to promote safe brushing by sensing the pressure applied during brushing. The bristles contain a small Force Sensitive Resistor located underneath to measure force in real time. It is connected to a small circuit with LED light feedback. Green LED indicates safe pressure, and red LED warns when pressure becomes excessive. This will prevent the gums and teeth from being damaged.It will also allow light brushing to be effective in cleaning.It was tested against different weights and functioned in the given range of 1.0 to 2.5 N. Without compromising on the minimum structure of a manual toothbrush, integrating smart sensing into this solution provides a cost-effective toothbrush for better oral health.","Unlike the electric toothbrush that vibrates or spins, this one retains the traditional look and cheapness of a manual brush, with enlightenment pressure sensing. Installing a force sensor with a low profile along with a tiny circuit in the handle and the brush head, this builds something akin to a true retro-style toothbrush. This also makes for a cheap and convenient brush that offers real-time feedback on brushing force. By focusing on keeping the sensing simple and low-cost rather than pursuing complex electronics, this design appeals to the everyday user and will likely have applications in both scenarios.","●	Detects applied brushing force using FSR.

●	Green LED: safe pressure range (100 to 250 g  or1.0–2.5 N).

Problem Statement:
 Bangladesh has thousands of budget hotels and homestays, but they were unorganized, inconsistent in quality, and difficult to book. Travelers, especially young professionals and students, struggled with:
* No guarantee of cleanliness or basic amenities
* No centralized booking platform
* Price unpredictability and lack of trust

Solution (HCP Inn’ Idea):
 We will aggregate small hotels & homestays, give them a common brand (HCP Inn), and enforce minimum quality standards (clean linen, Wi-Fi, AC, breakfast). Customers can book these rooms instantly through a mobile app/website at affordable, transparent prices.

Business Model (Early Pitch):
Partner with unbranded & budget hotels based on its location & environment →
* Standardize rooms with standard kit (bedsheets, toiletries, Wi-Fi routers, breakfast tie-ups)
* List them online → Customers book through HCP Inn app/site
Maintains the price, collaborate & supervise the hotel admins & facilities through a separate online app to fasten & solidify the process
* OYO earns via commission (~20%) per booking

Vision:
HCP Inn will be the Home for Common People who seeks for quality lodging facilities with budget price- building the world’s largest branded network of budget stays without owning real estate.","Amirul Islam
Final Year Student of Tourism and Hospitality Management, Faculty of Business Studies, University of Dhaka.
Senior Mentor & Academic Researcher of DP Tutorials- a study abroad consultancy firm.","Onboard property / partner: 
Unbranded hotels, homestays, short-term rentals which are facing financial losses for years despite being at a tourist based geographic location sign partnership agreements (franchise/management) and adopt HCP Inn’s branding & operating standards. HCP Inn provides an asset-transformation playbook (renovation checklist, standard amenities, photography & listing). 

Technology + distribution: 
 The property is connected to HCP Inn’s distribution (app/website + OTA channels) and HCP Inn’s internal systems (HCP OS / PMS; dynamic pricing engine). This increases occupancy and provides analytics for owners.

Revenue capture & settlement: 
HCP Inn keeps an agreed commission / management fee (varies by contract) on gross booking value (GBV) and passes the rest to the owner after settlements. In some properties HCP Inn still uses managed/leased models, but the company has largely pivoted to franchise/asset-light plus selective company-serviced hotels. 

Budget-friendly Lodging facilities at developing tourist destinations:
HCP Inn will offer a budget convenient accommodation service for travellers who seeks quality experience with a lower price at developing tourist destinations. Both Hotel owners & customers will be benefited.
","Standardization at scale for budget supply: 
HCP Inn turned the “room” into a standardized, brandable SKU (clean sheets, Wi-Fi, toiletries, easy booking) across heterogeneous small hotels — creating trust in a fragmented segment.

Rapid onboarding playbook:
 HCP Inn historically promised extremely quick property rollouts (days to weeks) with standard fit-outs and listing readiness — fast scale that few local players matched in the early expansion years.

Data + dynamic pricing at owner scale: 
HCP Inn’s proprietary pricing/revenue management gives small owners institutional pricing and demand prediction capabilities that were previously unavailable to them.

Hybrid portfolio strategy: 
combination of asset-light franchising (lower capex) plus a growing company-serviced segment (higher control/higher margin) — the latter is an important part of HCP Inn’s margin/revenue play.","Partners / Owners (what HCP Inn provides)
* HCP OS / PMS & Owner App — single pane to manage inventory, check-ins, daily revenue, housekeeping logs and settlements. 
* Smart Pricing Manager / Dynamic pricing — rules + ML-driven price recommendations and automated price adjustments for day-of/demand surges. 
* Onboarding & supply chain — design standards, renovation guidelines, bulk procurement (linens, toiletries).
* Marketing & distribution — access to HCP Inn’s D2C channels (app/website), corporate bookings (SilverKey/Capital O), and cross-listing on OTAs.


Guests (customer-side):
* Mobile app + web booking with standardized photos & amenity expectations.
* Loyalty / Wizard & promotions (repeat customer benefits). 
* Digital check-in / 24/7 support and unified refunds/claims policy through HCP Inn customer service. 


Monetization features (how HCP Inn captures value):
* Commissions / Take-rate on bookings (variable; common band 15–25%): charged on gross booking value depending on contract & services. 
* Management / service fees for company-operated hotels; leasing income where HCP Inn holds inventory.","Proprietary PMS (HCP OS):
 central to operations — inventory management, channel manager, owner and guest apps. External evaluations (hotel tech analysts) list HCP Inn OS as a full-stack PMS targeted at small hotels and home managers.


Dynamic pricing & revenue-management ML:
 HCP Inn introduced a Smart Pricing Manager feature that allows automated price adjustments within specified ranges (aim: optimize RevPAR/occupancy). The company’s data-science group (acquisitions and hires historically, e.g., Qlik Pass / Danamica) feed demand signals into pricing models.


Operational analytics & partner dashboards: 
HCP Inn delivers performance metrics to owners (GBV per storefront, occupancy, ARR — reported improvements in GBV per storefront in filings).


Scale + integration capability:
 HCP Inn integrates inventory with OTAs, corporate channels and GDS-level distribution for corporate/tour operators; this tech integration is central to their global expansion (and to recent deals like Motel 6 where scale and tech were the strategic assets).",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

The team started in 2023 and brought glory for Bangladesh by becoming the first Asian team to reach Elon Musk’s “Not-A-Boring Competition” in the USA. In 2024 we achieved 3rd place overall and received the “Rookie Award” from The Boring Company. Again, this year, in March 2025, our cutterhead became the best. Following these, our company was RJSC registered on 10th December, 2024. It has been brought under Grameenphone's 'Cholo Bangladesh' campaign (2024-2026). Our vision is to develop a Bangladesh-made tunnel-boring industry that reduces dependence on expensive foreign contractors, lowers urban disruption, and accelerates infrastructure growth.","Our team currently has 10 members in the organogram and 25 engineers (non-paid) from leading institutions such as UTM (Universiti Teknologi Malaysia), BUET, RUET, MIST, SUST, DU, UIU, IUT, Brac University etc. Members specialize in mechanical design, electrical and electronic systems, robotics, IoT, and project management. We work in partnership with BITAC (Bangladesh Industrial Technical Assistance Centre) for lab and manufacturing facilities. Our team is currently lead by Nafis Ashraf along with several sub-team leads and engineers. This multidisciplinary approach allows us to integrate advanced automation, sensors, and data systems into heavy construction machinery  - something unprecedented in Bangladesh.","Bangladesh faces chronic problems with traffic jams, road digging by multiple agencies (WASA, DESCO, BPDB etc.), and high costs for underground utilities, sewerage, pipe jacking and metro infrastructure. Our solution is a low-cost, IoT-enabled micro-tunnel boring machine (MTBM) built entirely in Bangladesh which can do the following : 
i. It can dig precise underground passages for utilities with minimal surface disruption.
ii. It integrates real-time sensors and remote monitoring so engineers can track performance and soil conditions instantly.
iii. It’s designed to be modular and portable, making it suitable for crowded urban environments where large TBMs cannot be used. Since it is trenchless, after launching it from the 'launching station', it keeps on digging underground (while cars can ply on the road at the same time) and after it is done digging, we can extract the TBM from the retrieval station (so roads need not be blocked during the entire duration of digging).
Lastly, this technology can cut project time by 30–40%, cost by up to 50% compared with importing foreign TBMs or open-cut trenching. Besides, urban flooding is also expected to reduce by 5% (in the 1st quarter) and air pollution by 7%.","i. First Bangladesh-made tunnel boring machine with IoT integration.
ii. Recognized by Elon Musk and is constantly under R&D in collaboration with Elon's company 'The Boring Company' engineers.
iii. Cross-institutional student R&D project bringing together multiple universities and disciplines.
iv. Focused on local manufacturing using BITAC facilities, reducing costs and creating new technical skills in Bangladesh (taking BITAC on Int'l level).
v. Positioned to transform how underground infrastructure is built - faster, safer, less disruptive.
vi. Goes directly with BIDA Chairman Chowdhury Ashik's new planning of representing Bangladesh as the 'Rising Star of Asia'.","i. IoT-enabled smart machine: Our MTBM integrates pressure, temperature, vibration, soil condition and machine-health sensors into a live dashboard. The dashboard gives real-time analytics, alerts and control to project managers. Because underground GPS signals are weak or absent, the system combines inertial sensors, gyroscopes, and laser/target referencing to keep accurate navigation even in GPS-denied environments.
ii. Advanced navigation & steering: High-power navigation and steering allow centimeter-level accuracy in route following, letting us place tunnels exactly under roads, rail lines or rivers without surface disruption.
iii. Automated muck removal: A built-in conveyor/slurry system continuously removes excavated soil, cutting downtime and reducing labor needs.
iv. Modular cutter head and shield: Easily adapted for different Bangladeshi soil types.
v. Compact design: Works in congested urban areas where large imported TBMs cannot operate.
vi. Comprehensive service model: Besides selling the MTBM as a complete unit to government and non-government projects, 'Bored Tunnelers' can offer it as a service package - navigation and guidance services, IoT dashboard and analytics, mechanical and civil works, operator training and maintenance. This makes it easy for utilities or contractors to adopt the technology without buying the whole machine.
vii. Data logging & analytics: All drilling parameters are automatically recorded, allowing post-project reporting and continuous improvement.
viii. R&D in partnership with DRMTCL: Currently developing 'purpoising' capability to allow controlled steering and more efficient tunnelling.
ix. Proven in field tests: Already test-run at the Metro Rail Line-5 Depot in Hemayetpur and at Elon Musk’s The Boring Company grounds in Bastrop, Texas, USA.","i. Robust mechanical design tested in real soil conditions at BITAC.
ii. Advanced electronics and automation (Our in-house EEE team designs and fabricates custom PCBs, sensor networks, power management modules, control boards and embedded firmware, enabling seamless integration of automation, real-time data acquisition and safety features into the MTBM).
iii. Built using local manufacturing processes (CNC, 3D printing, welding) to international standards.
iv. Directly addresses Bangladesh’s pressing needs: reducing urban disruption, lowering infrastructure costs, and building domestic technical capacity.
v. Potential to create a new industrial segment in Bangladesh for smart underground construction equipment.",Yes,No,No,No

Advisor (Mentor): Md. Moshiur Rahman – Faculty Mentor, Department of Software Engineering, BDU","SmartTrafficAI is an AI-powered adaptive traffic signal control system designed to solve Bangladesh’s growing urban congestion problem. Unlike traditional fixed-time or manually operated signals, our solution uses real-time computer vision and deep reinforcement learning to dynamically optimize traffic light timings based on actual road conditions.

The system deploys low-cost surveillance cameras at intersections, where a custom-trained YOLOv8 model detects and classifies vehicles, measuring queue lengths, density, and speed. This data is processed by a Dynamic Weight-based Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (DWMORA) algorithm, which continuously learns and adapts signal timing to minimize waiting times, reduce fuel consumption, and cut carbon emissions.

To ensure scalability, the system integrates a Coordinated Adjacent Intersection Approach (CAIA). This allows intersections to self-coordinate in a decentralized manner, avoiding heavy communication infrastructure costs. By doing so, SmartTrafficAI can be deployed city-wide, even in resource-constrained environments like Dhaka.

Our solution has been tested in traffic simulation platforms (SUMO, CityFlow) and is being prepared for real-world pilot deployment in Dhaka intersections. Results show significant improvements in reducing delays and congestion compared to conventional methods.

Beyond congestion management, SmartTrafficAI has the potential to prioritize emergency vehicles and public transport, improving response times and service efficiency. In the future, it can also integrate pedestrian and bicycle flows to create a comprehensive smart mobility ecosystem.

By combining affordability, AI-driven intelligence, and real-world adaptability, SmartTrafficAI directly supports the Smart Bangladesh 2041 vision, contributing to safer, greener, and more efficient urban transportation.","SmartTrafficAI is unique because it is the first Bangladesh-focused AI-powered traffic management solution that combines affordability, scalability, and real-time adaptability. Unlike traditional fixed-time signals or imported smart systems that rely on costly sensors and centralized infrastructure, SmartTrafficAI uses low-cost cameras with YOLOv8 computer vision for real-time vehicle detection and traffic flow measurement, making it practical for local deployment.

Its Dynamic Weight-based Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (DWMORA) algorithm balances multiple goals—reducing waiting time, cutting fuel waste, and lowering emissions—rather than optimizing only a single factor. Additionally, the Coordinated Adjacent Intersection Approach (CAIA) enables intersections to self-coordinate without heavy communication infrastructure, making large-scale city-wide deployment feasible in resource-constrained environments.

Another key differentiator is that the system is custom-built for Dhaka’s mixed and unpredictable traffic, unlike many international solutions designed for structured Western roads. This ensures real-world applicability and direct impact in the Bangladeshi context.

By combining AI innovation, local adaptability, and sustainability, SmartTrafficAI stands out as a low-cost yet high-impact solution that directly contributes to Bangladesh’s Smart City and Smart Bangladesh 2041 vision.","SmartTrafficAI functions as a real-time adaptive traffic signal control system that continuously learns and responds to changing road conditions. Its operation is built on three core layers: perception, intelligence, and coordination.

Real-Time Vehicle Detection

Uses low-cost surveillance cameras with YOLOv8 computer vision to detect vehicles, estimate speed, and measure queue lengths.

Provides accurate traffic density data without expensive IoT hardware.

AI-Powered Decision Making

Employs Dynamic Weight-based Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (DWMORA) to dynamically adjust signal timings.

Optimizes across multiple goals such as reducing delays, shortening queues, minimizing fuel waste, and lowering emissions.

Decentralized Coordination

Implements the Coordinated Adjacent Intersection Approach (CAIA), allowing intersections to self-coordinate without heavy communication infrastructure.

Ensures smooth traffic flow across city-wide networks with scalability and resilience.

Key Features

Adaptive Signal Timing – Automatically adjusts lights based on live traffic flow.

Scalability – Designed for deployment across entire cities, from single intersections to complex networks.

Low-Cost Implementation – Uses existing or affordable CCTV cameras instead of costly sensors.

Hybrid Evaluation – Tested in both simulators (SUMO, CityFlow) and selected Dhaka intersections for real-world validation.

Future Integration – Can prioritize ambulances, buses, and emergency vehicles; extendable to pedestrians and bicycles.

By combining AI intelligence, low-cost hardware, and decentralized scalability, SmartTrafficAI delivers a practical, sustainable, and locally adaptable solution for Bangladesh’s traffic management challenges.","SmartTrafficAI applies state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision to create a practical, high-quality solution for Bangladesh’s traffic congestion. The system integrates multiple advanced technologies into a unified framework that is both innovative and locally feasible.

At the perception level, YOLOv8 computer vision enables accurate, real-time vehicle detection, speed estimation, and traffic density measurement from low-cost surveillance cameras. This eliminates the need for expensive physical sensors, ensuring affordability and scalability for cities like Dhaka.

At the decision-making level, the system uses a Dynamic Weight-based Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (DWMORA) algorithm. Unlike traditional single-objective models, DWMORA balances multiple factors—reducing delays, minimizing queues, cutting fuel usage, and lowering emissions. This ensures optimized performance even under Bangladesh’s chaotic and mixed-traffic conditions.

At the coordination level, Coordinated Adjacent Intersection Approach (CAIA) allows decentralized communication-free synchronization between intersections. This unique approach avoids dependency on costly, high-bandwidth networks, making the system resilient and more suited to developing city infrastructures.

The solution has undergone rigorous testing in SUMO and CityFlow simulations and is being piloted in real-world Dhaka intersections to validate reliability, adaptability, and efficiency. Its modular design ensures compatibility with existing traffic infrastructure while providing a pathway for future enhancements, such as emergency vehicle prioritization and integration of pedestrian flows.

","Application of E-Vo (Electronic Voting)

1. Modernizing Democratic Processes
E-Vo serves as a digital bridge between citizens and governance by replacing traditional paper-based voting with a secure, fully automated electronic platform. It streamlines every stage of an election—voter registration, identity verification, ballot casting, and results tabulation—into a seamless, real-time digital workflow. This modernization dramatically reduces the time and cost of organizing elections and minimizes human error.

2. Accessibility and Inclusion
A core application of E-Vo is to ensure that every eligible citizen can vote with ease, regardless of location or physical ability. Remote or absentee voters, citizens living abroad, persons with disabilities, and those in rural areas can securely cast their ballots through internet-enabled devices or designated electronic kiosks. This fosters a more inclusive democracy by reducing logistical barriers to participation.

3. Enhanced Security and Trust
E-Vo systems leverage advanced technologies such as end-to-end encryption, multi-factor authentication, and—where appropriate—blockchain-based audit trails. These safeguards ensure vote integrity, prevent tampering, and create a transparent record that can be independently verified. The application of cryptographic verification not only secures each individual ballot but also strengthens public confidence in the electoral outcome.

4. Real-Time Data and Rapid Results
Unlike manual vote counting, E-Vo provides instant, accurate tallies. Election commissions and observers can monitor live participation metrics and preliminary results with robust analytics dashboards. This accelerates the announcement of outcomes, reduces disputes, and allows governments to transition swiftly to post-election processes.

5. Cost Efficiency and Environmental Impact
By digitizing ballots and reducing the need for printing, transportation, and large physical polling stations, E-Vo significantly cuts the financial and environmental costs of elections. Fewer paper ballots mean less waste, and automated counting minimizes the need for large human teams and extended counting periods.

6. Policy and Governance Applications
Beyond national or regional elections, E-Vo can be applied in corporate shareholder voting, university student government elections, professional association ballots, and local civic decision-making such as participatory budgeting or community referendums. Its adaptability makes it a versatile tool for any decision-making process that requires secure, large-scale consensus.

7. Crisis-Resilient Voting
During pandemics, natural disasters, or other emergencies, E-Vo ensures that democratic participation remains uninterrupted. Its ability to support remote and contactless voting protects both public health and the continuity of governance.

Raziur Alam (GIS specialist and Graphics designer)","Project Nirapotta-AI is an end-to-end disaster management platform designed to save lives and enhance community resilience in the face of escalating climate threats in Bangladesh. The project's primary goal is to bridge the critical gaps in both pre-disaster warning and post-disaster response through a unified, AI-powered system.
The platform integrates two core components.
•	First, a Proactive Early Warning System (EWS) that fuses macro-level satellite data (from sources like NASA) with a novel network of low-cost, ground-based IoT sensors. Our AI model will process this data to generate hyper-local, real-time flood and storm surge predictions. Crucially, these warnings will be disseminated not via complex apps, but through accessible, low-tech channels like automated voice calls (IVR), SMS, and community-based sirens, ensuring they reach the most vulnerable populations.
•	Second, a Reactive Damage Assessment System that activates post-disaster. Using AI-driven computer vision to rapidly analyze satellite and real-time imagery, the system will automatically map the extent of damage to buildings, infrastructure, and agricultural lands.
This integrated approach provides disaster management authorities with a seamless ""single pane of glass"" view, from predictive risk mapping before a disaster to an actionable damage map for targeted response afterward. The purpose of Nirapotta.AI is to transform disaster management from a siloed, reactive process into a data-driven, proactive cycle of resilience, ultimately minimizing human suffering and economic loss.
","Project Nirapotta.AI is a two-pronged, integrated solution built on a foundation of AI, IoT, and Earth Observation data.
Component 1: The Proactive Early Warning System (EWS)
Our strategy moves beyond generic regional forecasts to deliver actionable, hyper-local warnings.
a)	Three-Tier Data Fusion: The system's AI prediction engine will be fueled by three layers of data for unparalleled accuracy.
•	Macro-Level: Satellite data from NASA (GPM for precipitation) and ESA (Sentinel for soil moisture).
•	Meso-Level: National and regional meteorological forecasts from BMD.
•	Micro-Level (Our Key Innovation): Real-time ground-truth data from our custom-built, rugged IoT sensors placed in rivers, canals, and coastal estuaries. This data corrects biases in satellite models and captures localized phenomena that are otherwise missed.

b)	AI-Powered Prediction: A deep learning model (e.g., a Graph Neural Network) will analyze these fused data streams to generate dynamic risk maps, predicting not just if a flood will occur, but where, when, and at what likely depth.

c)	Inclusive Dissemination: The system's output is translated into simple, clear warnings and delivered via technologies that bridge the digital divide. An alert trigger automatically initiates SMS blasts, pre-recorded voice calls in Bengali to basic feature phones, and activates physical sirens in community centers.
Component 2: The Reactive Damage Assessment System
This component activates once a disaster has passed to enable a rapid, data-driven response.
•	AI-Powered Computer Vision: We will train a semantic segmentation model (e.g., U-Net) on pre-disaster imagery and open datasets of disaster damage. After an event, the model will process fresh satellite, drone or other real-time captured imagery to perform change detection, automatically creating a detailed damage map.

•	Actionable Intelligence: The output is not raw data, but a clear, color-coded map classifying areas into categories like ""Severe Structural Damage,"" ""Major flooding,"" and ""Roads Obstructed."" This allows first responders to immediately identify the most critical zones and plan the safest and fastest access routes.
These two components are unified in a single .NET-based web dashboard, providing authorities a continuous operational picture from preparedness to recovery. ","Proactive Early Warning System (EWS)

Three-Tier Data Fusion: Combines satellite data (NASA, ESA), national meteorological forecasts, and real-time IoT sensor inputs.

Shahjada Alif,muhammedalif2004@gmail.com,"This project, XG-Guard, was conceived, designed, and developed entirely by a solo student developer. It demonstrates advanced, interdisciplinary skills in: 1. Machine Learning Engineering (XGBoost model training, feature vector matching), 2. High-Performance Systems Programming (Golang reverse proxy development), and 3. Network Security Architecture. The successful integration of these complex components by a single individual underscores the applicant's profound technical capability and deep commitment to solving real-world security challenges.","This project, XG-Guard, was conceived, designed, and developed entirely by a solo student developer.","XG-Guard is a next-generation reverse proxy WAF built in Golang for unparalleled speed and concurrency. It integrates a sophisticated, pre-trained XGBoost machine learning model directly into the traffic inspection pipeline. Instead of relying on brittle rules, the proxy intercepts incoming HTTP payloads, extracts features via a custom-implemented character n-gram Hashing Vectorizer (matching the training setup), and feeds the sparse vector to the XGBoost model for real-time classification. This approach allows the system to predict whether a payload is malicious based on structural patterns, achieving high accuracy against both known and novel attacks.","The most significant unique factor of XG-Guard is its shift from a reactive, rule-based security model to a proactive, predictive AI model. While commercial WAFs rely on massive, constantly-updated rule sets (which are slow and can be bypassed), XG-Guard utilizes a trained XGBoost classifier to analyze the fundamental, structural properties of a payload using character n-grams. ","XG-Guard is engineered as a high-performance, AI-driven security gateway providing predictive defense at the application layer. Its core functionality is the real-time malicious payload classification of incoming HTTP requests, achieved by integrating a pre-trained XGBoost machine learning model directly within a high-concurrency Golang reverse proxy. This process begins with a custom, native Golang character n-gram Hashing Vectorizer that generates features with ultra-low latency, ensuring feature parity with the trained model. This allows for multi-class attack categorization to identify specific threats (like XSS or SQLi), offering granular security intelligence. Beyond classification, the system acts as a non-blocking reverse proxy, minimizing performance overhead while enabling configurable security actions—allowing administrators to immediately block the malicious request, alert security teams, or log the event based on policy, thereby transforming the traffic inspection pipeline into a powerful, automated security defense mechanism.","The technological foundation of XG-Guard demonstrates high quality through both ML rigor and system engineering excellence. The engine utilizes an XGBoost classifier, selected for its superior performance on high-dimensional, sparse data, rigorously trained with mlogloss and early stopping to ensure robust generalization against novel threats. The data quality is maintained through advanced feature engineering using the character n-gram Hashing Vectorizer, critical for identifying structural attack patterns. Critically, the successful application of this technology lies in its deployment: the entire system is engineered in Golang to guarantee the high-concurrency and ultra-low latency necessary for an inline network defense solution. A major technical achievement was the precise, custom re-implementation of the scikit-learn feature extraction logic within the Golang environment, which ensures perfect feature fidelity and maintains the model's accuracy and predictive power while operating at network speeds, making XG-Guard a viable, high-performance security application.",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes

","My father is a farmer who works diligently in the morning and evening.  I encountered an issue last winter when I visited my village. Most of our employees were on holiday, so I worked diligently with my father to feed poultry, which was hard work and time-consuming. The number of poultry farms in the area is approximately 1200, and the process of feeding and watering the chickens is both time-consuming and challenging.  Additionally, employing a large number of laborers to manage the many chickens is costly.  Additionally, it is contingent upon the weather and temperature. 
A 2024 statistic indicates that the poultry industry in Bangladesh employs 9 million individuals.  Bangladesh is home to approximately 75,000 to 150,000 poultry farms, as indicated by government and private sources.  This rate is increasing at an average rate of 15% annually. 
I have identified numerous solutions to this issue thus far; however, the systems that have been developed are based on a structural framework and have not yet been customized to accommodate small businesses, which is a costly endeavor. Therefore, I devised a solution that will reduce labor usage by approximately 40 to 50%, provide observation data, foretell weather conditions, and, of course, save costs. Additionally, it will save time during the process of feeding and watering.  
This project introduces a smart weather monitoring and management system for poultry farming that is based on the Internet of Things (IoT). The system is intended to enhance productivity, reduce labor, and enhance animal welfare by engaging in real-time monitoring and automation.  By employing a combination of microcontrollers and sensors, the system continuously monitors critical environmental variables within the poultry house, including temperature, humidity, light intensity, and moisture.  Predicting daily environmental conditions using all real-time data for performance monitoring and historical analysis further enhances the system's intelligence. All sensor data can be accessed via Wi-Fi on smartphones or web browsers.
","1. The system integrates real-time automation, predictive weather analytics, and remote access into a single, cost-effective platform tailored for poultry farming.
2. Unlike traditional systems that rely on manual control or fixed automation, this solution uses real-time environmental feedback to adaptively manage farm operations.
3. It includes cloud-linked data logging via Google Sheets, enabling:
   - Live updates of sensor data
   - Long-term trend analysis

4. A Python-based weather prediction module leverages historical data to deliver accurate forecasts, enhancing the system's decision-making capabilities.
5. This combination of intelligent automation, remote monitoring, and predictive analytics at a low cost is rarely available in existing agricultural solutions.

","Real-Time Monitoring: Continuously tracks temperature, humidity, light intensity, and soil moisture using high-precision sensors.

Automated Control: Uses microcontroller-driven logic to manage fans, lights, water pumps, and feeders based on sensor input.

Remote Accessibility: All system data is accessible via mobile and web dashboards, enabling 24/7 remote supervision.

Data Logging: Automatically logs sensor data to Google Sheets for historical tracking and performance analysis.

Alert System: Sends real-time notifications when environmental conditions exceed acceptable thresholds.

Machine Learning Integration: A Python-based module predicts future weather conditions, allowing proactive environmental adjustments.

Energy Efficiency: LDR-based light control ensures minimal energy waste by syncing artificial lighting with natural light cycles.
","The solution demonstrates strong engineering quality by integrating robust hardware with cloud-based services and machine learning tools. The use of open-source technologies, such as NodeMCU, DHT11/22 sensors, LDRs, and Google Sheets, ensures cost-effectiveness without compromising reliability. Real-time Wi-Fi connectivity enhances scalability, allowing deployment across multiple locations with minimal infrastructure changes.
The machine learning model adds a layer of intelligence that differentiates this system from basic automation. It applies predictive analytics to support operational decisions, showcasing how advanced computing methods can be leveraged in agriculture.
This technology is highly applicable not only in small and medium poultry farms but also scalable for commercial operations. Its modular design and remote capabilities make it suitable for adoption in rural, resource-constrained settings, delivering high impact at a low cost.

Asif Ahmed - AI & ML ","Our platform is a complete digital system built to solve the biggest problems for small farmers by connecting three key services.
First, we provide Predictive Analytics to help farmers make smart and profitable decisions before they even plant. Our system analyzes two key areas: what will grow best and what will sell best. To understand what will grow best, it collects and analyzes data like the farm's one-time baseline soil data (N, P, K), its crop history, real-time weather data for that specific union, and even pictures of crop leaves. This helps determine which crops are best suited for that specific soil, diagnoses diseases, and provides correct fertilizer instructions. At the same time, to figure out what will be most profitable, our AI analyzes past market prices, current market demand, and data from the Ministry of Agriculture. Based on all this information, the system then gives the farmer a simple list of the top three recommended crops, complete with their potential profit and a ""Risk Score,"" ensuring they plant what is not only suitable for their land but also has high market value.

Second, our 
Information Aggregator for logistics works like an ""Uber for cold storage"" to prevent crops from spoiling after harvest. Cold storage owners can list their empty spaces in our app. A farmer can then easily find a nearby storage location and rent a small amount of space for a short time, for example, space for just 20 crates of vegetables for 3 days. A dynamic pricing algorithm helps set fair rental prices based on demand, reducing costs in the off-season to ensure maximum use of storage facilities.



Finally, our F2B Marketplace connects these farmers directly to big buyers. We do this through our ""Digital Co-operative"" model, which automatically groups small farmers together. When a large order comes in from a buyer like a supermarket, our AI automatically divides that order among the farmers in the group based on their production ability and quality score. To ensure trust and fair pricing, this is where our 
AI-Powered Quality Assurance comes in. Using cameras and AI software, the system automatically grades produce into ""Grade A,"" ""Grade B,"" or ""Grade C"" based on size, color, and blemishes, eliminating any chance of human bias. This ensures that buyers receive the exact quality they paid for, building confidence in the marketplace. . When a large order comes in from a buyer like a supermarket, our AI automatically divides that order among the farmers in the group based on their production ability and quality score
 Once the deal is confirmed, the farmer can receive an instant loan of up to 80% of the order's value from our financial partners. This advance cash helps the farmer cover costs, including transportation. The platform also arranges transport automatically; once a deal is final, a trip request is created, and truck drivers bid for the job. The system automatically gives the job to the lowest bidder, making transport cheap and efficient
","Three services combined in one: crop forecasting, storage solution, and direct market access.

","RideGuardian by InnoSphere is an innovative IoT-based safety solution that automatically detects vehicle crashes and instantly sends an emergency alert with GPS location via SMS to pre-set contacts and hospitals. Using an MPU6050 sensor for impact detection, NEO-6M GPS for precise tracking, and SIM800L GSM module for communication, the system ensures immediate response during road accidents. Designed for both helmet-integrated and portable use, this low-cost, energy-efficient device aims to save lives by bridging the critical communication gap between accident occurrence and emergency assistance — because every second saves a life.","The project is unique because it works automatically without any smartphone or internet. It uses sensors, GPS, and GSM to detect real accidents and send instant emergency messages with location. To avoid false alarms, it follows a two-step check — first, it senses a strong impact, then it confirms if the motion stays unstable for a few seconds before sending alerts. Its portable and helmet versions make it usable for all riders, and its low cost and energy-saving design make it perfect for developing countries like Bangladesh.","The RideGuardian project detects accidents automatically using motion and impact sensors (MPU6050). To reduce false alerts, it uses a two-step verification process: first, the sensor checks if acceleration exceeds the crash threshold; second, a short confirmation delay ensures the event is not a minor bump. Once a real crash is confirmed, it triggers a buzzer alert, fetches the GPS location, and sends an SMS to an emergency contact. If GPS fix isn’t available within 10 seconds, it still sends a basic accident alert. After a 30-second delay, the system resets for the next detection.","•	Accident Detection: Uses MPU6050 sensors to detect crashes with a two-step verification process to reduce false alerts (threshold check + short confirmation delay).
	•	Immediate Alert: Triggers a buzzer and sends an SMS to an emergency contact with a Google Maps link of the location.
	•	GPS Backup: If GPS fix isn’t available within 10 seconds, sends a basic accident alert.
	•	Automatic Reset: Resets after 30 seconds for the next detection.

Traditional water billing systems often rely on manual meter readings and shared billing methods, which can lead to inaccurate usage records, delayed billing, and unfair cost distribution among residents. To overcome these limitations, our system integrates IoT technology, smart water meters, and a centralized cloud platform to automate the entire billing process.

Each apartment or household is equipped with a digital flow sensor that measures real-time water usage. The collected data is transmitted wirelessly to a central server through Wi-Fi or GSM modules, where it is processed and stored. The system then automatically calculates individual water bills based on actual consumption and predefined tariff rates. Users can access their water usage data and billing information through a web or mobile dashboard, which also provides insights into daily, weekly, or monthly consumption patterns.
